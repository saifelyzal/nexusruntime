# Release E2E Curl Matrix

This file contains end-to-end curl scenarios for release validation.
These scenarios are prepared for execution across these local gateways:

- `http://localhost:18080` - SQLite-backed main test gateway
- `http://localhost:18081` - PostgreSQL-backed smoke gateway
- `http://localhost:18082` - MongoDB-backed smoke gateway
- `http://localhost:18083` - SQLite-backed guardrail gateway
- `http://localhost:18084` - SQLite-backed auth + exact-cache gateway
- `http://localhost:18090` - mock MCP upstream (`tests/e2e/mockmcp`, started by
  the stack manager; `/alpha` requires the `X-Mock-Token` header, `/beta` is
  open)

## Recommended runner

Use the checked-in runner to execute this matrix without manually replaying the
shared setup blocks:

```bash
tests/e2e/manage-release-e2e-stack.sh start
tests/e2e/run-release-e2e.sh
tests/e2e/run-release-e2e.sh --list
tests/e2e/run-release-e2e.sh --from S54 --to S58
tests/e2e/run-release-e2e.sh --scenario S61,S62,S70 --keep-artifacts
tests/e2e/run-release-e2e.sh --scenario S137,S138,S139,S140,S141 --jobs 4
tests/e2e/manage-release-e2e-stack.sh status
tests/e2e/manage-release-e2e-stack.sh stop
```

The runner treats this markdown file as the source of truth, replays the setup
blocks automatically for each scenario, writes a raw log plus a TSV summary
under `QA_RUN_DIR` (default: `/tmp/gomodel-release-e2e-$QA_SUFFIX`), and
supports partial reruns.

Stateful note:

- `S13`-`S60` mutate shared aliases/files/batches
- `S64`-`S79` mutate managed keys, workflows, and auth artifacts
- `S80`-`S85` mutate response snapshots and response-cache artifacts
- `S86`-`S89` mutate budget settings and budgets
- `S90` mutates stored usage pricing fields on the no-master-key gateway
- `S96`-`S109` exercise the Anthropic Messages API ingress endpoint and are
  self-contained (`S104` creates and deletes its own alias); they can be rerun
  in any order
- `S110`-`S114` exercise the OpenAI-compatible audio endpoints
  (`POST /v1/audio/speech`, `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`); each generates its
  own input audio under `QA_RUN_DIR`, so they are self-contained and can be rerun
  in any order
- `S115`-`S117` exercise the realtime voice websocket endpoint with curl
  upgrade handshakes across OpenAI, xAI, and Bailian; they are self-contained
  and can be rerun in any order
- `S118`-`S125` exercise load-balanced virtual models (round-robin, weighted,
  cost, rename, negatives); each creates `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped sources and deletes
  them, so they are self-contained and rerunnable in any order
- `S126`-`S132` exercise token throughput and cache analytics; they are
  read-mostly (`S128`/`S132` add a little usage/cache traffic) and self-contained
- `S133`-`S141` exercise failover and chained virtual models (create, resolve,
  cycle and dependency validation, disabled-leg skipping, persisted target
  ordering, and auth gating); each positive
  scenario creates `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped virtual models and deletes them, so they
  are self-contained and rerunnable in any order
- `S142`-`S148` exercise header tagging (admin rule CRUD, validation negatives,
  label extraction onto usage entries and audit `data.labels`, streaming,
  PostgreSQL/MongoDB backend parity, and auth gating); each scenario uses
  `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped header names and restores an empty operator rule set, so
  they are self-contained and rerunnable in any order. Env/config-managed rules
  and `do_not_pass` passthrough stripping need gateways booted with custom
  config plus a mock upstream, so they are covered by Go unit tests rather than
  this running-stack matrix
- `S149`-`S154` are post-v0.1.48 provider regressions (DeepSeek, Ollama,
  Fireworks through the shared OpenAI-compatible core); they are read-only and
  rerunnable in any order. `S151`/`S152` need a local Ollama server with at
  least one chat model and `S153`/`S154` need an active Fireworks account —
  each prints a loud `SKIPPED:` line and exits 0 when its upstream dependency
  is unavailable, and fails on any gateway-side problem
- `S155`-`S159` exercise scoped rate limits (admin CRUD, user-path request and
  token enforcement, model-scope saturation, auth gating); each creates
  `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped probe rules and deletes them, so they are
  self-contained, but `S158` saturates `deepseek/deepseek-flash` for up to
  one minute after it runs
- `S163`-`S172` exercise the MCP gateway (admin CRUD with secret redaction,
  aggregation/namespacing, tools/prompts/resources relay, usage and audit
  logging with JSON-RPC bodies, identity-bound sessions, store parity on
  PostgreSQL/MongoDB) plus provider `request_health` on
  `/admin/providers/status`; each scenario registers `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped
  servers against the local mock MCP upstream on port 18090 and deletes them,
  so they are self-contained and rerunnable in any order
- `S160`-`S162` exercise `/v1/conversations` CRUD, responses/conversations
  persistence on the PostgreSQL and MongoDB backends, and the rewrite-savings
  usage summary fields; they clean up after themselves and are rerunnable in
  any order
- IaC virtual-models behavior (declarative `VIRTUAL_MODELS`/`config.yaml`,
  managed read-only, env-over-YAML, startup validation) needs gateways launched
  with custom config, so it is covered by a standalone script rather than this
  running-stack matrix (`tests/e2e/test-iac-virtualmodels.sh`)
- Storage upgrade behavior (a database written by an older release, read and
  written by this one) needs two binaries, so it is covered by
  `tests/e2e/upgrade-compat.sh` rather than this matrix, which always runs one
  binary against whatever the stack already holds
- `S173`-`S182` exercise the Anthropic Messages drop-in compatibility fixes
  (`x-api-key` auth fallback, `stop_sequence`, seeded stream usage,
  dialect-aware `/v1/models` and 404s); `S173`-`S175` need the auth-enabled
  gateway (`$AUTH_BASE_URL`), the rest are read-mostly on `$BASE_URL` and
  rerunnable in any order
- `S183`-`S191` exercise the Anthropic Message Batches API
  (`/v1/messages/batches*`); each creates its own `msgbatch_`-scoped batch and
  is rerunnable in any order, but (like `S47`-`S48`) they leave
  `in_progress`/`canceling` batches behind since the scenarios do not wait for
  a real provider batch to end. Bedrock Mantle (`internal/providers/bedrockmantle`)
  has no running-stack coverage here: no `BEDROCK_MANTLE_API_KEY`/AWS
  credentials are available in `.env`, so it is covered by its unit test suite
  (`config_test.go`, `bedrock_mantle_test.go`) plus a one-off manual check that
  a `BEDROCK_MANTLE_*`-prefixed provider registers distinctly from `BEDROCK_*`
  at startup without colliding or crashing
- `S192`-`S196` exercise the dashboard-managed provider-credentials store
  (`/admin/provider-credentials` CRUD, `/types`, secret redaction, hot
  register/unregister into the routing catalog, config/env read-only negatives,
  PostgreSQL/MongoDB parity, admin-auth gating); each registers
  `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped provider names against unreachable base URLs and deletes
  them, so they are self-contained and rerunnable in any order
- `S197`-`S204` exercise budgets scoped to a request label rather than a
  `user_path` subtree (admin CRUD and validation negatives, tagging-header
  label enforcement with verbatim/case-sensitive matching, multi-label
  charging in one lookup, managed-API-key label charging, a request matched by
  both a `user_path` and a `label` budget at once, reset-one, PostgreSQL/MongoDB
  parity, and auth gating); each is self-contained and rerunnable in any
  order. `S200` deliberately registers its managed key on the auth-enabled
  gateway rather than the no-master-key main SQLite gateway — see the note on
  that scenario for why
- `S205`-`S207` exercise request-window persistence across `SIGHUP` reload on
  SQLite, reset-one across reload, and PostgreSQL/MongoDB parity. Each creates
  a `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped **shared** hour rule (not `per_child` — this stack has
  no `quota_templates` entitlement) and deletes it. They reload a shared
  gateway, which is safe in this sequential runner.
- `S208`-`S215` exercise the OpenAI-compatible image endpoints
  (`/v1/images/generations`, `/v1/images/edits`) across OpenAI and Gemini's
  native API, including registry routing, negatives, metering, and audit
  image-body placeholders; each is self-contained (`S210` creates and deletes
  its own alias) and rerunnable in any order. Storing image pixels in the audit
  log (`LOGGING_LOG_IMAGE_BODIES`) needs a gateway booted with that variable
  on, so it is covered by unit tests rather than this matrix
- `MODEL_LIST_URL=off`, conditional model-list fetches (`ETag`/`304`), and the
  vLLM `reasoning_content` rename need a custom-booted gateway or an upstream
  this stack has no credentials for, so they stay on unit tests too
- `S216`-`S217` exercise realtime `intent=transcription` sessions and the
  unchanged default speech session; they are read-only and rerunnable in any
  order
- `S220`-`S223` exercise realtime speech translation sessions on
  `/v1/realtime/translations`, the equivalent `intent=translation` dial, the
  translation client-secret mint, and the rejection of a translation session on a
  provider that has no translation surface; they are read-only and rerunnable in
  any order
- `S224` exercises provider inventory filtering on OpenRouter. The stack manager
  defaults `OPENROUTER_MODEL_FILTER_INCLUDE` to `*:free`, which leaves models
  used by the rest of the matrix untouched; the scenario is read-only and
  rerunnable in any order
- `S225`-`S228` cover recent release regressions: image content nested in an
  Anthropic `tool_result`, time-window pricing merged with an operator override,
  tolerant admin listing of a virtual model with corrupt SQL timestamps, and a
  Gemini 3 tool call replayed with its thought signature. They create and clean
  up their own artifacts and are rerunnable in any order; `S227` reloads the
  SQLite gateway and therefore stays sequential
- `S218` exercises Gemini's native `batchEmbedContents` path (batch input,
  `dimensions`); read-only and rerunnable in any order
- `S219` asserts the effective resilience configuration on
  `/admin/providers/status`, including the circuit-breaker enable switch;
  read-only and rerunnable in any order
- For stateful partial reruns, prefer a contiguous range that includes the
  prerequisite setup scenarios, or rerun with the same `--qa-suffix` and
  `--keep-artifacts`
- `--jobs N` is available for explicit `--scenario` lists made entirely of
  runner-approved independent scenarios. The runner rejects shared-state IDs;
  full-matrix and stateful-range runs remain sequential

grep -Eq '^# HELP gomodel_requests_total|^gomodel_requests_total' "$METRICS_FILE"
```

### S03 Public models list

Checks `/v1/models` and prints a small sample.

```bash
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" \
  | jq -e '
      .object == "list"
      and (.data | length) > 0
      and all(.data[]; (.id | type == "string" and length > 0) and .object == "model")
    ' >/dev/null
```

### S67 Verify scoped workflow detail

Reads the created workflow back and confirms the normalized scope and effective feature projection.

```bash
require_release_artifact "$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE"
WORKFLOW_ID=$(<"$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE")
WORKFLOW_DETAIL_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s67.workflow-detail.json"
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID" \

    and .effective_features.failover == false
  ' "$WORKFLOW_DETAIL_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S68 Managed-key request through scoped workflow

Sends a request with the managed API key while also sending a conflicting `X-GoModel-User-Path` header.

```bash
require_release_artifact "$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE"
API_KEY=$(<"$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE")
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s68.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s68.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_AUTH_REQ1" \
  -H 'X-GoModel-User-Path: /team/should-be-overridden' \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_AUTH_CACHE_OFF_OK"}],"max_tokens":16}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e '.choices[0].message.content == "QA_AUTH_CACHE_OFF_OK"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
if grep -Eiq '^X-Cache:' "$HEADERS_FILE"; then
  echo "error: cache header present on cache-disabled scoped request" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### S69 Repeated managed-key request should still bypass cache

Repeats the same request and expects another live provider response rather than `X-Cache: HIT`.

```bash
require_release_artifact "$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE"
API_KEY=$(<"$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE")
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s69.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s69.body.XXXXXX")

  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_AUTH_REQ2" \
  -H 'X-GoModel-User-Path: /team/should-be-overridden' \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_AUTH_CACHE_OFF_OK"}],"max_tokens":16}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e '.choices[0].message.content == "QA_AUTH_CACHE_OFF_OK"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
if grep -Eiq '^X-Cache:' "$HEADERS_FILE"; then
  echo "error: repeated cache-disabled scoped request returned an X-Cache header" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### S70 Audit evidence for managed-key scoped workflow

Confirms through audit-log search that auth method, managed auth key ID, normalized user path, workflow ID, and no cache hit are all recorded together. The list projection is slimmed (`bodies_omitted: true`), so the response body is asserted through `/admin/audit/detail`.

```bash
sleep 6
require_release_artifact "$QA_AUTH_KEY_JSON"
require_release_artifact "$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE"
if ! AUTH_KEY_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$QA_AUTH_KEY_JSON"); then

### S71 Global cache warm request with explicit user path

Warms the global cache-enabled workflow using the master key and a cache-specific user path.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s71.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s71.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_CACHE_REQ1" \
  -H "X-GoModel-User-Path: $QA_CACHE_USER_PATH" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly $QA_CACHE_REPLY\"}],\"max_tokens\":32}"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e --arg reply "$QA_CACHE_REPLY" '.choices[0].message.content == $reply' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
if grep -Eiq '^X-Cache:' "$HEADERS_FILE"; then
  echo "error: initial cache warm request unexpectedly returned an X-Cache header" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### S72 Repeated global cache request should hit exact cache

Repeats the same request and expects `X-Cache: HIT (exact)`.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s72.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s72.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \

  -d "{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly $QA_CACHE_REPLY\"}],\"max_tokens\":32}"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e --arg reply "$QA_CACHE_REPLY" '.choices[0].message.content == $reply' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
grep -Eiq '^X-Cache: HIT \(exact\)' "$HEADERS_FILE"
```

### S73 Cache overview filtered by user path

Checks cache analytics after the exact-cache hit using the same tracked user path.

```bash
sleep 6
CACHE_OVERVIEW_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s73.cache-overview.json"
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview?days=1&user_path=$QA_CACHE_USER_PATH" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  > "$CACHE_OVERVIEW_JSON_FILE"
jq '.' "$CACHE_OVERVIEW_JSON_FILE"
jq -e '.summary.total_hits >= 1 and .summary.exact_hits >= 1' "$CACHE_OVERVIEW_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S74 Cached usage log filtered by user path

Reads cached-only usage entries for the same exact-hit request path.

```bash
CACHED_USAGE_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s74.cached-usage.json"
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?days=1&user_path=$QA_CACHE_USER_PATH&cache_mode=cached&limit=5" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  > "$CACHED_USAGE_JSON_FILE"
jq '{total,entries:(.entries|map({request_id,cache_type,model,provider,endpoint,user_path,total_tokens}))}' "$CACHED_USAGE_JSON_FILE"
jq -e --arg request_id "$QA_CACHE_REQ2" '
    .total >= 1
    and any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $request_id and .cache_type == "exact")
  ' "$CACHED_USAGE_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S75 Invalid managed API key user path (negative)

Verifies user-path validation for managed API key creation.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s75.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s75.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X POST "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/auth-keys" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"name":"qa-invalid-user-path","user_path":"/team/../alpha"}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("invalid user_path"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S76 Invalid workflow scope user path (negative)

Verifies user-path validation for workflow creation.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s76.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s76.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X POST "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/workflows" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \

sed -n '1,24p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,24p' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("invalid scope_user_path"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

## 13. Authenticated cleanup

### S77 Deactivate managed API key

Deactivates the managed key created for the auth-enabled release run.

```bash
AUTH_KEYS_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s77.auth-keys.json"
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/auth-keys" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  > "$AUTH_KEYS_JSON_FILE"
if ! AUTH_KEY_ID=$(jq -er --arg name "$QA_AUTH_KEY_NAME" '.[] | select(.name == $name) | .id' "$AUTH_KEYS_JSON_FILE"); then
  echo "error: managed API key id not found for $QA_AUTH_KEY_NAME" >&2
  exit 1
fi
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s77.headers.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o /dev/null -X POST "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/auth-keys/$AUTH_KEY_ID/deactivate" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 204 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
```

### S78 Deactivated managed API key is rejected

Confirms that the same managed key can no longer authenticate requests.

```bash
require_release_artifact "$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE"
API_KEY=$(<"$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE")
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s78.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s78.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_DEACTIVATED_REQ" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_AUTH_DEACTIVATED"}],"max_tokens":16}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
sed -n '1,20p' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 401 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "authentication_error"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S79 Deactivate scoped workflow

Deactivates the workflow created for the scoped managed-key release run.

```bash
require_release_artifact "$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE"
WORKFLOW_ID=$(<"$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE")
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s79.headers.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o /dev/null -X POST "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/workflows/$WORKFLOW_ID/deactivate" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 204 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
rm -f "$QA_AUTH_KEY_JSON" "$QA_AUTH_KEY_VALUE_FILE" "$QA_WORKFLOW_JSON" "$QA_WORKFLOW_ID_FILE"
```

## 14. Responses lifecycle and cache

### S80 Create stored Responses snapshot

Creates a non-streaming Responses API result and stores its gateway response ID for lifecycle retrieval.

```bash
RESPONSE_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s80.response.json"
RESPONSE_ID_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s80.response.id"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/responses" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-mini","input":"Reply with exactly QA_RESPONSE_LIFECYCLE_OK","max_output_tokens":20}' \
  > "$RESPONSE_JSON_FILE"
jq '{id,object,status,model,provider,output}' "$RESPONSE_JSON_FILE"
jq -er '.id | select(type == "string" and length > 0)' "$RESPONSE_JSON_FILE" > "$RESPONSE_ID_FILE"
assert_responses_response_contains "$RESPONSE_JSON_FILE" "openai" "QA_RESPONSE_LIFECYCLE_OK"
```

### S81 Retrieve stored Responses snapshot

Reads the response created in `S80` through `GET /v1/responses/{id}`.

```bash
RESPONSE_ID_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s80.response.id"
RETRIEVED_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s81.response-retrieved.json"
require_release_artifact "$RESPONSE_ID_FILE"
RESPONSE_ID=$(<"$RESPONSE_ID_FILE")
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/responses/$RESPONSE_ID" \
  > "$RETRIEVED_JSON_FILE"
jq '{id,object,status,model,provider,output}' "$RETRIEVED_JSON_FILE"
jq -e --arg response_id "$RESPONSE_ID" '
    .id == $response_id
    and .object == "response"
    and .status == "completed"
    and (.provider == "openai")
    and any(.output[]?.content[]?; .type == "output_text" and (.text | contains("QA_RESPONSE_LIFECYCLE_OK")))
  ' "$RETRIEVED_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S82 List stored Responses input items

Reads normalized input items captured from the `S80` create request.

```bash
RESPONSE_ID_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s80.response.id"
INPUT_ITEMS_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s82.response-input-items.json"
require_release_artifact "$RESPONSE_ID_FILE"
RESPONSE_ID=$(<"$RESPONSE_ID_FILE")
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/responses/$RESPONSE_ID/input_items?limit=10" \
  > "$INPUT_ITEMS_JSON_FILE"
jq '{object,has_more,first_id,last_id,data}' "$INPUT_ITEMS_JSON_FILE"
jq -e '
    .object == "list"
    and (.data | length) >= 1
    and .data[0].type == "message"
    and .data[0].role == "user"
    and .data[0].content[0].type == "input_text"
    and (.data[0].content[0].text | contains("QA_RESPONSE_LIFECYCLE_OK"))
  ' "$INPUT_ITEMS_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S83 Delete stored Responses snapshot

Deletes the stored gateway response created in `S80`.

```bash
RESPONSE_ID_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s80.response.id"
DELETE_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s83.response-delete.json"
require_release_artifact "$RESPONSE_ID_FILE"
RESPONSE_ID=$(<"$RESPONSE_ID_FILE")
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/v1/responses/$RESPONSE_ID" \
  > "$DELETE_JSON_FILE"
jq '{id,object,deleted}' "$DELETE_JSON_FILE"
jq -e --arg response_id "$RESPONSE_ID" '
    .id == $response_id
    and .object == "response.deleted"
    and .deleted == true
  ' "$DELETE_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S84 Responses exact-cache warm request

Warms the exact response cache for `/v1/responses` on the auth/cache gateway.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s84.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s84.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/responses" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_RESP_CACHE_REQ1" \
  -H "X-GoModel-User-Path: $QA_CACHE_USER_PATH" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"input\":\"Reply with exactly $QA_RESP_CACHE_REPLY\",\"max_output_tokens\":32}"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '{id,model,provider,status,output}' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e --arg reply "$QA_RESP_CACHE_REPLY" '
    any(.output[]?.content[]?; .text == $reply)
  ' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
if grep -Eiq '^X-Cache:' "$HEADERS_FILE"; then
  echo "error: initial responses cache warm request unexpectedly returned an X-Cache header" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### S85 Repeated Responses request should hit exact cache

Repeats the same `/v1/responses` request and expects `X-Cache: HIT (exact)`.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s85.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s85.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/responses" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $QA_RESP_CACHE_REQ2" \
  -H "X-GoModel-User-Path: $QA_CACHE_USER_PATH" \
  -d "{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"input\":\"Reply with exactly $QA_RESP_CACHE_REPLY\",\"max_output_tokens\":32}"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '{id,model,provider,status,output}' "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e --arg reply "$QA_RESP_CACHE_REPLY" '
    any(.output[]?.content[]?; .text == $reply)
  ' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
grep -Eiq '^X-Cache: HIT \(exact\)' "$HEADERS_FILE"
```

## 15. Budget management

### S86 Budget admin validation and lifecycle

Checks budget settings validation, manual budget creation, and deletion on the main SQLite-backed gateway.

```bash
BUDGET_PATH="/team/budget/admin/$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s86.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s86.body.XXXXXX")

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"daily_reset_hour":24}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq . "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("daily_reset_hour"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"daily_reset_hour":1,"daily_reset_minute":15,"weekly_reset_weekday":2,"monthly_reset_day":2}' \
  | jq -e '.daily_reset_hour == 1 and .daily_reset_minute == 15 and .weekly_reset_weekday == 2 and .monthly_reset_day == 2'

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"user_path\":\"$BUDGET_PATH\",\"budget_key\":{\"period\":\"daily\"},\"amount\":-1}"
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq . "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("amount"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"user_path\":\"$BUDGET_PATH\",\"budget_key\":{\"period\":\"weekly\"},\"amount\":12.5}" \
  | jq -e --arg user_path "$BUDGET_PATH" '
      any(.budgets[]?; .user_path == $user_path and .period_seconds == 604800 and .amount == 12.5 and .source == "manual")
    ' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"user_path\":\"$BUDGET_PATH\",\"budget_key\":{\"period\":\"weekly\"}}" \
  | jq -e --arg user_path "$BUDGET_PATH" 'all(.budgets[]?; .user_path != $user_path)' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"daily_reset_hour":0,"daily_reset_minute":0,"weekly_reset_weekday":1,"weekly_reset_hour":0,"weekly_reset_minute":0,"monthly_reset_day":1,"monthly_reset_hour":0,"monthly_reset_minute":0}' \
  >/dev/null
```

### S87 SQLite budget enforcement and audit

Creates a tiny daily budget, verifies the first request is recorded as spend, and verifies the next request is blocked with an OpenAI-compatible rate-limit error.

```bash
run_release_budget_enforcement \
  "$BASE_URL" \
  "$QA_BUDGET_SQLITE_PATH" \
  "s87-sqlite-budget" \
  "QA_BUDGET_SQLITE_OK_$QA_BUDGET_SUFFIX"
```

### S88 PostgreSQL budget enforcement and audit

Runs the same budget enforcement flow against the PostgreSQL-backed gateway.

```bash
run_release_budget_enforcement \
  "$PG_BASE_URL" \
  "$QA_BUDGET_PG_PATH" \
  "s88-postgres-budget" \
  "QA_BUDGET_POSTGRES_OK_$QA_BUDGET_SUFFIX"
```

### S89 MongoDB budget enforcement and audit

Runs the same budget enforcement flow against the MongoDB-backed gateway.

```bash
run_release_budget_enforcement \
  "$MONGO_BASE_URL" \
  "$QA_BUDGET_MONGO_PATH" \
  "s89-mongo-budget" \
  "QA_BUDGET_MONGO_OK_$QA_BUDGET_SUFFIX"
```

## 16. No-master-key admin mutations

### S90 Usage pricing recalculation without master key

Runs the pricing recalculation action on the main SQLite-backed gateway. The release stack starts this gateway with `GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY` unset, so the request intentionally sends no `Authorization` header.

```bash
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/recalculate-pricing" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"confirmation":"recalculate"}' \
  | jq -e '.status == "ok" and (.matched | type == "number") and (.recalculated | type == "number")'
```

## 17. Dashboard live preview

These scenarios exercise the `/admin/live/logs` SSE feed that powers the
dashboard's realtime audit/usage panel. The auth/cache gateway is used because
it serves the dashboard and requires master-key authentication for admin
routes.

### S91 Live preview heartbeat from an idle subscriber

Subscribes with a future cursor (no replay), waits past one heartbeat interval, and asserts the SSE stream emits `event: reset` followed by at least one `event: heartbeat`.

```bash
LIVE_OUT="$QA_RUN_DIR/s91.live.sse"
curl -sS --no-buffer -N "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/live/logs?types=audit,usage&cursor=999999999" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  --max-time 20 > "$LIVE_OUT" || true
grep -cE '^event: reset' "$LIVE_OUT" | jq -R -e 'tonumber >= 1' >/dev/null
grep -cE '^event: heartbeat' "$LIVE_OUT" | jq -R -e 'tonumber >= 1' >/dev/null
```

### S92 Live preview emits audit + usage events for a fresh chat

Opens an SSE subscription, triggers one chat completion with a unique request id, then asserts the captured stream contains an `audit.*` event whose JSON payload references that request id and at least one `usage.*` event.

```bash
LIVE_OUT="$QA_RUN_DIR/s92.live.sse"
RID="qa-live-preview-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -sS --no-buffer -N "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/live/logs?types=audit,usage" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  --max-time 18 > "$LIVE_OUT" &
LIVE_PID=$!
sleep 1
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_LIVE_PREVIEW_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' \
  > "$QA_RUN_DIR/s92.chat.json"
sleep 8
kill "$LIVE_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
wait "$LIVE_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
assert_chat_response_contains "$QA_RUN_DIR/s92.chat.json" "openai" "QA_LIVE_PREVIEW_OK"
grep -cE '^event: audit\.' "$LIVE_OUT" | jq -R -e 'tonumber >= 1' >/dev/null
grep -cE '^event: usage\.' "$LIVE_OUT" | jq -R -e 'tonumber >= 1' >/dev/null
grep '^data: {' "$LIVE_OUT" | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | jq -e --arg rid "$RID" 'select(.. | strings? | tostring | contains($rid)) | .seq | type == "number"' \
  | head -n1 >/dev/null
```

### S93 Live preview type filter excludes off-list categories

Subscribes with `types=usage` only, fires another chat, and asserts the captured stream contains `usage.*` events with no `audit.*` events leaking through.

```bash
LIVE_OUT="$QA_RUN_DIR/s93.live.sse"
RID="qa-live-filter-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -sS --no-buffer -N "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/live/logs?types=usage" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  --max-time 18 > "$LIVE_OUT" &
LIVE_PID=$!
sleep 1
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -d '{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_LIVE_FILTER_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' \
  > "$QA_RUN_DIR/s93.chat.json"
sleep 8
kill "$LIVE_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
wait "$LIVE_PID" 2>/dev/null || true
assert_chat_response_contains "$QA_RUN_DIR/s93.chat.json" "openai" "QA_LIVE_FILTER_OK"
grep -cE '^event: usage\.' "$LIVE_OUT" | jq -R -e 'tonumber >= 1' >/dev/null
if grep -qE '^event: audit\.' "$LIVE_OUT"; then
  echo "error: audit.* event leaked through types=usage filter" >&2
  exit 1
fi
```

### S94 Live preview rejects invalid cursor with 400

Verifies the endpoint validates the `cursor` query parameter rather than silently dropping it.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s94.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s94.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/live/logs?cursor=not-a-number" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER"
sed -n '1,10p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq . "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("cursor"; "i"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S95 Streaming client disconnect is audited as `client_disconnected`

Starts a streaming chat completion, aborts it within 400 ms (before the upstream connection completes), then asserts the audit row reflects the request as a streaming request that was cancelled by the client rather than as an upstream provider failure.

```bash
RID="qa-stream-cancel-$QA_SUFFIX"
timeout 0.4 curl -sS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Write a 200 word poem about caches."}],"max_tokens":256}' \
  > "$QA_RUN_DIR/s95.partial.sse" 2>/dev/null || true
sleep 6
AUDIT_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s95.audit.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/audit/log?search=$RID&limit=5" > "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE"
jq --arg rid "$RID" '{entries:(.entries|map(select(.request_id==$rid))|map({request_id,status_code,stream,error_type,path}))}' "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE"
jq -e --arg rid "$RID" '
    any(.entries[]?;
      .request_id == $rid
      and .path == "/v1/chat/completions"
      and .stream == true
      and .error_type == "client_disconnected"
    )
  ' "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

## 18. Anthropic Messages API ingress

These scenarios exercise the `/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens`
endpoints added in the Anthropic Messages API ingress feature. The endpoint
accepts the Anthropic Messages request dialect, translates it to the canonical
chat request, routes it through the standard chat-completions pipeline (so it
works with any configured provider), and renders responses back in the
Anthropic Messages shape. The main SQLite-backed gateway is used because it
runs in unsafe mode (no master key) with audit logging enabled.

### S96 Non-streaming message on an Anthropic model

Checks a basic Messages request served by the native Anthropic provider.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s96.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":64,"system":"You are terse.","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_ANTHROPIC_OK"}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{id,type,role,model,stop_reason,usage,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '
    .type == "message"
    and .role == "assistant"
    and (.id | type == "string" and startswith("msg_"))
    and (.content | length) >= 1
    and (any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MESSAGES_ANTHROPIC_OK"))))
    and (.usage.input_tokens > 0)
    and (.usage.output_tokens > 0)
    and (.stop_reason | type == "string" and length > 0)
  ' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S97 Messages request translated to a non-Anthropic provider

Checks that the Anthropic dialect is provider-agnostic: an OpenAI model served
through `/v1/messages` still returns an Anthropic Messages envelope.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s97.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_OPENAI_OK"}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{id,type,role,model,stop_reason,usage,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '
    .type == "message"
    and .role == "assistant"
    and (any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MESSAGES_OPENAI_OK"))))
    and (.usage.output_tokens > 0)
  ' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S98 Streaming message SSE

Checks SSE streaming with the Anthropic event sequence.

```bash
SSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s98.messages.sse"
curl -fsS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":32,"stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_STREAM_OK"}]}' \
  > "$SSE_FILE"
sed -n '1,24p' "$SSE_FILE"
for event in 'event: message_start' 'event: content_block_start' 'event: content_block_delta' 'event: message_delta' 'event: message_stop'; do
  if ! grep -qF "$event" "$SSE_FILE"; then
    echo "error: message stream is missing $event" >&2
    exit 1
  fi
done
grep -qF '"text_delta"' "$SSE_FILE" || { echo "error: message stream is missing a text_delta" >&2; exit 1; }
grep '^data: {' "$SSE_FILE" | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | jq -s -e --arg expected "QA_MESSAGES_STREAM_OK" '
      [.[] | select(.type == "content_block_delta") | .delta.text? // empty]
      | join("")
      | contains($expected)
    ' >/dev/null
```

### S99 System prompt supplied as a text-block array

Checks that the polymorphic `system` field is honored when sent as an array of
text blocks rather than a string.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s99.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":32,"system":[{"type":"text","text":"Always reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_SYSTEM_OK regardless of the user message."}],"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say something unrelated."}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{type,role,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e 'any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MESSAGES_SYSTEM_OK")))' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S100 Multi-turn conversation with an assistant turn

Checks that a conversation containing a prior `assistant` message is translated
and routed correctly.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s100.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Remember the code word is QA_MEMO_42."},{"role":"assistant","content":"Understood, I will remember it."},{"role":"user","content":"Reply with only the code word."}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{type,role,stop_reason,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e 'any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MEMO_42")))' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S101 Count message tokens

Checks the `/v1/messages/count_tokens` heuristic estimate endpoint.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s101.count-tokens.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/count_tokens" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":64,"system":"You are a helpful assistant.","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"How many tokens are in this Anthropic Messages request body?"}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '.' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '(.input_tokens | type == "number") and .input_tokens > 0' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S102 Forced tool use round-trip

Checks tool translation: an Anthropic `tools` definition with a `tool_choice`
that forces a specific tool yields an Anthropic `tool_use` content block.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s102.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":256,"tool_choice":{"type":"tool","name":"get_weather"},"tools":[{"name":"get_weather","description":"Get the current weather for a city","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{"city":{"type":"string"}},"required":["city"]}}],"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"What is the weather in Paris?"}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{type,stop_reason,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '
    .stop_reason == "tool_use"
    and any(.content[]; .type == "tool_use" and .name == "get_weather" and (.input | type == "object"))
  ' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S103 Multimodal image input

Checks an Anthropic image content block with a URL source.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s103.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini","max_tokens":20,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Reply with one digit only: which digit is visible in the image?"},{"type":"image","source":{"type":"url","url":"https://dummyimage.com/64x64/000/fff.png&text=7"}}]}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{type,role,usage,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "message" and .role == "assistant" and any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("7"))) and (.usage.output_tokens > 0)' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S104 Message through an alias

Checks that alias resolution applies to `/v1/messages` like the other inference
endpoints.

```bash
MESSAGES_ALIAS="qa-messages-alias-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$MESSAGES_ALIAS\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"description\":\"QA messages alias\"}" \
  >/dev/null
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s104.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$MESSAGES_ALIAS\",\"max_tokens\":32,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_ALIAS_OK\"}]}" \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{type,role,model,content}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "message" and any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MESSAGES_ALIAS_OK")))' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$MESSAGES_ALIAS\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S105 Missing `max_tokens` is rejected with an Anthropic error envelope (negative)

Checks that a request missing the required `max_tokens` field is rejected as a
`400` rendered in the Anthropic error envelope (`type: "error"`).

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s105.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s105.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("max_tokens"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S106 Empty messages array is rejected (negative)

Checks that a request with an empty `messages` array is rejected.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s106.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s106.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":16,"messages":[]}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("messages"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S107 Unknown model is rejected with an Anthropic error envelope (negative)

Checks that an unresolvable model produces a `404` Anthropic error envelope.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s107.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s107.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"does-not-exist-model","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hi"}]}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 404 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "not_found_error" and (.error.message | test("does-not-exist-model|model"; "i"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S108 Unsupported content block type is rejected (negative)

Checks that a content block type without a canonical chat equivalent (e.g.
`browser_state`) is rejected rather than silently dropped. Document blocks are
supported and therefore must not be used as the negative probe.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s108.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s108.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":[{"type":"browser_state"}]}]}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("browser_state|unsupported"; "i"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S109 Messages request is visible in the audit log

Checks that a `/v1/messages` request is recorded in the audit log under the
`/v1/messages` path and is searchable by request ID.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-messages-audit-$QA_SUFFIX"
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s109.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $REQUEST_ID" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":24,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MESSAGES_AUDIT_OK"}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e 'any(.content[]; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_MESSAGES_AUDIT_OK")))' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
sleep 6
AUDIT_JSON_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s109.audit.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/audit/log?search=$REQUEST_ID&limit=5" > "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE"
jq --arg rid "$REQUEST_ID" '{entries:(.entries|map(select(.request_id==$rid))|map({request_id,path,requested_model,provider,status_code,error_type}))}' "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE"
jq -e --arg rid "$REQUEST_ID" '
    any(.entries[]?;
      .request_id == $rid
      and .path == "/v1/messages"
      and .status_code == 200
    )
  ' "$AUDIT_JSON_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S110 Text-to-speech returns binary audio

Checks `POST /v1/audio/speech`: a text-to-speech request returns binary audio
with the content type implied by `response_format`. Asserts HTTP 200, a
`Content-Type: audio/wav` response, and a valid RIFF/WAVE payload from upstream.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s110.headers.XXXXXX")
AUDIO_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s110.speech.wav"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$AUDIO_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini-tts","input":"Hello from the GoModel release matrix.","voice":"alloy","response_format":"wav"}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 200 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^content-type: *audio/wav' "$HEADERS_FILE"
# RIFF/WAVE magic bytes confirm real audio, not a JSON error body.
test "$(head -c 4 "$AUDIO_FILE")" = "RIFF"
test "$(dd if="$AUDIO_FILE" bs=1 skip=8 count=4 2>/dev/null)" = "WAVE"
test "$(wc -c < "$AUDIO_FILE")" -gt 1000
```

### S111 Speech-to-text round trip returns JSON transcript

Checks `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions`: synthesizes audio via the speech
endpoint, then transcribes it back. Asserts a `200` JSON response whose `text`
is a non-empty string. (Transcription fidelity is not asserted, only that the
multipart-in / JSON-out path works end to end.)

```bash
AUDIO_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s111.speech.wav"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini-tts","input":"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.","voice":"alloy","response_format":"wav"}' \
  > "$AUDIO_FILE"
test "$(head -c 4 "$AUDIO_FILE")" = "RIFF"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s111.headers.XXXXXX")
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s111.transcription.json"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$RESP_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -F "file=@$AUDIO_FILE;type=audio/wav" \
  -F 'model=gpt-4o-transcribe' \
  -F 'response_format=json'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$RESP_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 200 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^content-type: *application/json' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.text | type == "string" and (length > 0)' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S112 Speech-to-text honors the text response format

Checks that `response_format=text` returns a `text/plain` body rather than JSON,
confirming the gateway derives the response content type from the request.

```bash
AUDIO_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s112.speech.wav"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini-tts","input":"Plain text transcription check.","voice":"alloy","response_format":"wav"}' \
  > "$AUDIO_FILE"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s112.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s112.transcription.txt"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/transcriptions" \
  -F "file=@$AUDIO_FILE;type=audio/wav" \
  -F 'model=gpt-4o-transcribe' \
  -F 'response_format=text'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
cat "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 200 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^content-type: *text/plain' "$HEADERS_FILE"
test "$(wc -c < "$BODY_FILE")" -gt 0
```

### S113 Speech without a voice is rejected (negative)

Checks that a text-to-speech request missing the required `voice` field is
rejected as a `400` OpenAI error envelope before any upstream call.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s113.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s113.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4o-mini-tts","input":"missing voice"}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("voice"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S114 Speech on an unknown model is not found (negative)

Checks that the audio router rejects an unknown model with a `404` not-found
error rather than forwarding it upstream.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s114.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s114.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"this-model-does-not-exist","input":"hi","voice":"alloy"}'
sed -n '1,20p' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq '.' "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 404 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "not_found_error"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S115 Realtime websocket upgrade on OpenAI

Checks `GET /v1/realtime`: curl performs a websocket upgrade handshake for an
OpenAI realtime voice model. The gateway dials upstream before accepting the
client, so a `101 Switching Protocols` response confirms model routing and
credential injection both worked.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-openai-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s115.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s115.body.XXXXXX")

```

### S116 Realtime websocket upgrade on xAI

Checks the xAI Grok Voice realtime API through the OpenAI-compatible realtime
entry point. The release stack configures `grok-voice-latest` explicitly because
xAI voice models are not reliably discoverable from `/models`.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-xai-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s116.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s116.body.XXXXXX")

  "$HEADERS_FILE" \
  "$BODY_FILE" \
  "$REQUEST_ID" \
  "$STDERR_FILE"
```

### S117 Realtime websocket upgrade on Bailian passthrough

Checks the provider-native realtime passthrough route for Alibaba Cloud Bailian
/ DashScope Qwen-Omni. The websocket event schema is relayed verbatim while the
gateway injects the Bailian bearer token.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-bailian-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s117.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s117.body.XXXXXX")
STDERR_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s117.stderr.XXXXXX")
assert_realtime_websocket_upgrade \
  "$BASE_URL/p/bailian/v1/realtime?model=qwen3-omni-flash-realtime" \
  "$HEADERS_FILE" \
  "$BODY_FILE" \
  "$REQUEST_ID" \
  "$STDERR_FILE"
```

## 14. Load-balanced virtual models

These scenarios exercise multi-target redirects (#433) on the main SQLite
gateway. Each scenario creates its own virtual models with a `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped
source and deletes them at the end, so they are self-contained and rerunnable in
any order. Targets are cheap, distinctly-attributable models so the resolved
`provider`/`model` reveals which target served each request.

### S118 Create and inspect a round-robin redirect

Creates a two-target round-robin redirect and verifies the admin view shape.

```bash
SRC="qa-lb-rr-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\",\"strategy\":\"round_robin\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"groq/groq/compound-mini\"}],\"description\":\"qa lb rr\"}" \
  | jq -e --arg s "$SRC" '
      .source == $s and .kind == "redirect" and .strategy == "round_robin"
      and (.targets | length) == 2
      and .targets[0].model == "openai/gpt-4.1-nano" and .targets[1].model == "groq/groq/compound-mini"
      and .enabled == true
    ' >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S119 Round-robin spreads requests across targets

Sends several requests through a round-robin redirect and confirms both target
providers serve traffic. Equal-weight, two-target round-robin alternates, so six
requests resolve to each provider three times.

```bash
SRC="qa-lb-rrd-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\",\"strategy\":\"round_robin\",\"session_affinity\":false,\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"groq/groq/compound-mini\"}]}" >/dev/null
for M in openai/gpt-4.1-nano groq/groq/compound-mini; do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$M\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5}" >/dev/null
done
PROVIDERS=""
for _ in $(seq 1 6); do
  P=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$SRC\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5,\"temperature\":0}" | jq -r '.provider')
  PROVIDERS="$PROVIDERS $P"
done
echo "providers:$PROVIDERS"
grep -q openai <<<"$PROVIDERS"
grep -q groq <<<"$PROVIDERS"
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S120 Weighted round-robin honors per-target weight

A target with weight 2 receives twice the share of a weight-1 target. Nine
requests split 6:3 in favor of the weighted target. Session affinity is declared
off for the same reason as `S119`: these nine requests are byte-identical, so
`SESSION_AUTO_DETECT` reads them as one session and affinity would pin every one
of them to the target that served the first — the weighting would never run.

```bash
SRC="qa-lb-w-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\",\"strategy\":\"round_robin\",\"session_affinity\":false,\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"weight\":2},{\"model\":\"groq/groq/compound-mini\",\"weight\":1}]}" >/dev/null
for M in openai/gpt-4.1-nano groq/groq/compound-mini; do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$M\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5}" >/dev/null
done
OPENAI=0; GROQ=0
for _ in $(seq 1 9); do
  P=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$SRC\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5,\"temperature\":0}" | jq -r '.provider')
  [ "$P" = openai ] && OPENAI=$((OPENAI+1)); [ "$P" = groq ] && GROQ=$((GROQ+1))
done
echo "openai=$OPENAI groq=$GROQ"
# Both targets must serve: a one-sided split would mean the balancer never
# rotated, which is what a pinned session looks like.
[ "$GROQ" -gt 0 ]
[ "$OPENAI" -gt "$GROQ" ]
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S121 Cost strategy routes to the cheapest target

The cost strategy always resolves to the cheapest catalog-priced target. With
`openai/gpt-4.1` (input+output 10/Mtok) and `openai/gpt-4.1-nano` (0.5/Mtok),
every request resolves to the nano model.

```bash
SRC="qa-lb-cost-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\",\"strategy\":\"cost\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1\"},{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}]}" >/dev/null
for _ in $(seq 1 3); do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$SRC\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5,\"temperature\":0}" \
    | jq -e '.model | test("nano")' >/dev/null
done
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S122 Rename a redirect via `old_source`

Renames a redirect to a new source. The new name resolves, the old name is
removed from the listing and no longer resolves as a redirect.

```bash
OLD="qa-lb-ren-$QA_SUFFIX"
NEW="qa-lb-ren2-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$OLD\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NEW\",\"old_source\":\"$OLD\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" \
  | jq -e --arg s "$NEW" '.source == $s and .kind == "redirect"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$NEW" --arg o "$OLD" 'any(.[]; .source == $n) and (all(.[]; .source != $o))' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$NEW\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5}" \
  | jq -e '.provider == "openai"' >/dev/null
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s122.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s122.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$OLD\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"hi\"}],\"max_tokens\":5}"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 404 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.code == "model_not_found"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$NEW\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S123 Unknown load-balancing strategy is rejected (negative)

A redirect with an unsupported strategy is rejected before storage.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s123.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s123.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"qa-lb-bad-$QA_SUFFIX\",\"strategy\":\"weighted\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"groq/groq/compound-mini\"}]}"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("strategy"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S124 Unknown target model is rejected (negative)

Every redirect target must resolve to a catalog-supported model at write time.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s124.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s124.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"qa-lb-bad2-$QA_SUFFIX\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"openai/this-model-xyz-404\"}]}"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("not found"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S125 Rename of a non-existent source fails without creating it (negative)

Renaming from an `old_source` that does not exist fails and does not create the
new source. NOTE: the current status code is `502 provider_error` ("virtual
model not found"); `DELETE` returns `404` for the same condition, so this is a
known status-code inconsistency in the rename path. This scenario asserts the
durable invariant (request fails, new source not created) rather than pinning
the exact code.

```bash
NEW="qa-lb-rmiss-$QA_SUFFIX"
HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$QA_RUN_DIR/s125.body" -w '%{http_code}' -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NEW\",\"old_source\":\"qa-lb-missing-$QA_SUFFIX\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}")
sed -n '1,20p' "$QA_RUN_DIR/s125.body"
[ "$HTTP" -ge 400 ]
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" | jq -e --arg n "$NEW" 'all(.[]; .source != $n)' >/dev/null
```

## 15. Token throughput and cache analytics

These scenarios exercise the overview live-throughput chart endpoint (#434) and
the cache-split usage analytics (#428). Throughput and `cache_mode` run on the
main gateway; cache overview and locally-cached accounting use the auth/cache
gateway where the exact response cache is enabled.

### S126 Token throughput window shape across granularities

Each granularity returns a fixed, zero-fillable window with the four token
series the live chart stacks.

```bash
check_throughput() {
  local gran="$1" bucket_seconds="$2" count="$3"
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/throughput?granularity=$gran" \
    | jq -e --arg g "$gran" --argjson bs "$bucket_seconds" --argjson n "$count" '
        .granularity == $g and .bucket_seconds == $bs and (.buckets | length) == $n
        and all(.buckets[];
          (.start | type == "string")
          and (.input_tokens | type == "number")
          and (.output_tokens | type == "number")
          and (.prompt_cached_tokens | type == "number")
          and (.locally_cached_tokens | type == "number"))
      ' >/dev/null
}
check_throughput second 1 60
check_throughput minute 60 60
check_throughput hour 3600 24
check_throughput day 86400 30
```

### S127 Token throughput rejects a missing or invalid granularity (negative)

Granularity is required and must be one of second/minute/hour/day.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s127.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s127.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/throughput"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/throughput?granularity=fortnight"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S128 Token throughput reflects live traffic

A fresh chat request shows up in the current minute buckets, confirming the chart
reads live from the usage store. The assertion checks the two most recent buckets
are non-empty *after* the request has flushed — a deterministic check that avoids
a before/after delta, which is racy when an earlier high-traffic bucket rolls out
of the trailing window exactly at a minute boundary.

```bash
RID="qa-throughput-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Say hello in ten words."}],"max_tokens":40}' >/dev/null
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  if curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?search=$RID&limit=3" \
    | jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
sleep 1
# The just-flushed request is < 60s old, so its tokens must land in one of the two
# most recent minute buckets.
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/throughput?granularity=minute" \
  | jq -e '([.buckets[-2,-1] | (.input_tokens + .output_tokens + .prompt_cached_tokens)] | add) > 0' >/dev/null
```

### S129 Usage summary honors `cache_mode`

The summary accepts `uncached`, `cached`, and `all`; `all` is at least as large
as `uncached`, and an unrecognized value is tolerated (normalized to uncached,
not rejected — Postel's law).

```bash
for MODE in uncached cached all; do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/summary?cache_mode=$MODE&days=30" \
    | jq -e '(.total_requests | type == "number") and (.total_tokens | type == "number")' >/dev/null
done
UNCACHED=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/summary?cache_mode=uncached&days=30" | jq '.total_tokens')
ALL=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/summary?cache_mode=all&days=30" | jq '.total_tokens')
[ "$ALL" -ge "$UNCACHED" ]
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/summary?cache_mode=bogus&days=30" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "200"' >/dev/null
```

### S130 Cache overview is unavailable when caching is off

On the main gateway the response cache is disabled, so the cache overview
reports the feature as unavailable.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s130.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s130.body.XXXXXX")
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 503 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.code == "feature_unavailable"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S131 Cache overview is served when caching is on

On the auth/cache gateway the exact response cache is enabled, so the overview
returns a valid summary and daily series. The endpoint requires authentication.

```bash
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  | jq -e '
      (.summary.total_hits | type == "number")
      and (.summary.total_tokens | type == "number")
      and (.daily | type == "array")
    ' >/dev/null
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "401"' >/dev/null
```

### S132 Locally-cached tokens are accounted from exact cache hits

A repeated identical request hits the exact response cache (`X-Cache: HIT
(exact)`). The hit is counted in the cache overview and surfaces as
`locally_cached_tokens` in the throughput window.

```bash
UP="/team/cache/throughput/$QA_SUFFIX"
PROMPT="Reply with exactly QA_LOCAL_CACHE_${QA_SUFFIX//[^[:alnum:]]/_}"
BODY="{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"$PROMPT\"}],\"max_tokens\":32,\"temperature\":0}"
HITS_BEFORE=$(curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" | jq '.summary.total_hits // 0')
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s132.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s132.body.XXXXXX")
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: qa-localcache-$QA_SUFFIX-1" -H "X-GoModel-User-Path: $UP" -d "$BODY"
if grep -Eiq '^X-Cache:' "$HEADERS_FILE"; then
  echo "error: cache warm request unexpectedly returned an X-Cache header" >&2
  exit 1
fi
curl -fsS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: qa-localcache-$QA_SUFFIX-2" -H "X-GoModel-User-Path: $UP" -d "$BODY"
grep -Eiq '^X-Cache: HIT \(exact\)' "$HEADERS_FILE"
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  if curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?cache_mode=cached&search=qa-localcache-$QA_SUFFIX-2&limit=3" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
    | jq -e 'any(.entries[]?; (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
HITS_AFTER=$(curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/cache/overview" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" | jq '.summary.total_hits // 0')
echo "cache hits before=$HITS_BEFORE after=$HITS_AFTER"
[ "$HITS_AFTER" -gt "$HITS_BEFORE" ]
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/usage/throughput?granularity=minute" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  | jq -e '([.buckets[].locally_cached_tokens] | add) > 0' >/dev/null
```

## 19. Failover strategy

Failover is a load-balancing behaviour of virtual models: every multi-target
redirect fails over between its targets, and the `failover` strategy makes the
target list a strict priority order. There are no separate failover endpoints;
these scenarios use `PUT/GET/DELETE /admin/virtual-models` on the main SQLite
gateway. Targets must exist in the catalog, so the scenarios use the models the
QA gateway is configured with.

### S133 Create a failover-strategy virtual model

Creates a two-target priority list and verifies the admin view carries the
strategy and the declared order.

```bash
NAME="qa-failover-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\",\"strategy\":\"failover\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"}]}" \
  | jq -e --arg name "$NAME" '.source == $name and .strategy == "failover" and (.targets | map(.model)) == ["openai/gpt-4.1-nano","gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite"]' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg name "$NAME" 'map(select(.source == $name)) | length == 1' >/dev/null
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\"}" | grep -q '^204$'
```

### S134 Failover strategy always serves the primary target

Creates its own priority list, sends two requests through it — both answered by
the first target (no rotation) — and removes it.

```bash
NAME="qa-failover-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\",\"strategy\":\"failover\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"}]}" >/dev/null
for i in 1 2; do
  curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"$NAME\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"ping $i\"}],\"max_tokens\":5}" \
    | jq -e '.model | test("gpt-4.1-nano")' >/dev/null
done
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\"}" | grep -q '^204$'
```

### S135 Failover for a real model by shadowing it

A redirect whose source is a real model and whose first target is that model
adds a failover chain to it; the model keeps resolving to itself.

```bash
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","strategy":"failover","targets":[{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano"},{"model":"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite"}]}' \
  | jq -e '.resolved_model == "openai/gpt-4.1-nano" and .valid == true' >/dev/null
# A redirect made only of its own source is rejected.
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano","targets":[{"model":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano"}]}' | grep -q '^400$'
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"source":"openai/gpt-4.1-nano"}' | grep -q '^204$'
```

### S136 Virtual model admin requires authentication

On the auth-enabled gateway the virtual model endpoints are gated behind the
admin key.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" | grep -q '^401$'
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" | jq -e 'type == "array"' >/dev/null
```

### S137 Chained virtual models resolve through the inner redirect

Creates an inner alias and an outer alias that targets it by name. The admin
view and a real request must both resolve to the inner concrete model.

```bash
INNER="qa-chain-inner-$QA_SUFFIX"
OUTER="qa-chain-outer-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$INNER\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$OUTER\",\"target_model\":\"$INNER\"}" \
  | jq -e --arg outer "$OUTER" '.source == $outer and .resolved_model == "openai/gpt-4.1-nano"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$OUTER\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_CHAIN_OK\"}],\"max_tokens\":20}" \
  | jq -e '.provider == "openai" and (.model | test("gpt-4.1-nano"))' >/dev/null
for SRC in "$OUTER" "$INNER"; do
  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
done
```

### S138 A chained virtual-model cycle is rejected (negative)

Creates `A -> concrete` and `B -> A`, then verifies that repointing A to B is
rejected with the cycle spelled out and leaves A's prior target intact.

```bash
A="qa-cycle-a-$QA_SUFFIX"
B="qa-cycle-b-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$A\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$B\",\"target_model\":\"$A\"}" >/dev/null
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s138.body.json"
curl -sS -o "$BODY_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$A\",\"target_model\":\"$B\"}" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "400"' >/dev/null
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("cycle"; "i"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg a "$A" 'any(.[]; .source == $a and .resolved_model == "openai/gpt-4.1-nano")' >/dev/null
for SRC in "$B" "$A"; do
  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
done
```

### S139 A referenced chained target cannot be deleted (negative)

An inner redirect remains protected while an outer redirect depends on it. Once
the outer redirect is removed, normal inner cleanup succeeds.

```bash
INNER="qa-dep-inner-$QA_SUFFIX"
OUTER="qa-dep-outer-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$INNER\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$OUTER\",\"target_model\":\"$INNER\"}" >/dev/null
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s139.body.json"
HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$BODY_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$INNER\"}")
[ "$HTTP" -ge 400 ]
jq -e '.error.message | test("target of|repoint|referenc|depend"; "i")' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg inner "$INNER" 'any(.[]; .source == $inner)' >/dev/null
for SRC in "$OUTER" "$INNER"; do
  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
done
```

### S140 A disabled chained leg is skipped

A failover redirect whose first leg is a disabled virtual model must route to
the next available concrete target.

```bash
DISABLED="qa-chain-disabled-$QA_SUFFIX"
OUTER="qa-chain-skip-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$DISABLED\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\",\"enabled\":false}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$OUTER\",\"strategy\":\"failover\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"$DISABLED\"},{\"model\":\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"}]}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$OUTER\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_CHAIN_SKIP_OK\"}],\"max_tokens\":20}" \
  | jq -e '.provider == "gemini" and (.model | test("gemini-2.5-flash-lite"))' >/dev/null
for SRC in "$OUTER" "$DISABLED"; do
  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null
done
```

### S141 Reordering failover targets persists and changes the primary

Re-saves one failover redirect with its targets reversed, then verifies both
the stored order and the provider selected from the new first position.

```bash
NAME="qa-reorder-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\",\"strategy\":\"failover\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"},{\"model\":\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"}]}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$NAME\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_REORDER_ONE\"}],\"max_tokens\":20}" \
  | jq -e '.provider == "openai"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\",\"strategy\":\"failover\",\"targets\":[{\"model\":\"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite\"},{\"model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}]}" \
  | jq -e '(.targets | map(.model)) == ["gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite","openai/gpt-4.1-nano"]' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg name "$NAME" 'any(.[]; .source == $name and (.targets | map(.model)) == ["gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-lite","openai/gpt-4.1-nano"])' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$NAME\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_REORDER_TWO\"}],\"max_tokens\":20}" \
  | jq -e '.provider == "gemini"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\"}" >/dev/null
```

### S142 Tagging settings CRUD, canonicalization, and validation negatives

Operator tagging rules are readable and replaceable through the admin API:
header names are canonicalized, the default delimiter is applied, and
credential-bearing, duplicate, or malformed headers are rejected with `400`
without clobbering the saved rule set. The scenario restores an empty operator
rule set at the end.

```bash
TAG_HDR_RAW="x-qa-tag-$QA_SUFFIX"
TAG_HDR="X-Qa-Tag-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  | jq -e '.editable == true and ((.headers // []) | type == "array")' >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$TAG_HDR_RAW\",\"prefix\":\"qa-\",\"do_not_pass\":true,\"delimiter\":\";\"},{\"header\":\"$TAG_HDR_RAW-b\"}]}" \
  | jq -e --arg h "$TAG_HDR" '
      ([.headers[] | select(.managed | not)] | length) == 2
      and (.headers[0].header | ascii_downcase) == ($h | ascii_downcase)
      and .headers[0].prefix == "qa-"
      and .headers[0].do_not_pass == true
      and .headers[0].delimiter == ";"
      and (.headers[1].header | ascii_downcase) == (($h + "-b") | ascii_downcase)
      and .headers[1].delimiter == ","
      and ((.headers[1].do_not_pass // false) == false)
    ' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  | jq -e --arg h "$TAG_HDR" 'any(.headers[]; (.header | ascii_downcase) == ($h | ascii_downcase) and .do_not_pass == true)' >/dev/null
for BAD in \
  '{"headers":[{"header":"Authorization"}]}' \
  '{"headers":[{"header":"Cookie"}]}' \
  '{"headers":[{"header":"x-api-key"}]}' \
  "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$TAG_HDR_RAW\"},{\"header\":\"$TAG_HDR\"}]}" \
  '{"headers":[{"header":"bad header name"}]}'; do
  STATUS=$(curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$BAD")
  [ "$STATUS" = "400" ]
done
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  | jq -e '([.headers[] | select(.managed | not)] | length) == 2' >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' \
  | jq -e '((.headers // []) | map(select(.managed | not)) | length) == 0' >/dev/null
```

### S143 Chat request labels land on the usage entry

Labels are extracted with prefix trimming (values without the prefix are kept
as-is), custom delimiters, repeated header values, and cross-rule dedupe, and
are recorded on the usage entry in rule order.

```bash
TEAM_HDR="X-Qa-Team-$QA_SUFFIX"
ENV_HDR="X-Qa-Env-$QA_SUFFIX"
RID="qa-tag-usage-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$TEAM_HDR\",\"prefix\":\"team-\"},{\"header\":\"$ENV_HDR\",\"delimiter\":\";\"}]}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -H "$TEAM_HDR: team-alpha, beta ,team-alpha" \
  -H "$TEAM_HDR: team-gamma" \
  -H "$ENV_HDR: prod;staging" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_TAG_USAGE_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' >/dev/null
USAGE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s143.usage.json"
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?search=$RID&limit=3" > "$USAGE_FILE"
  if jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
jq -e --arg r "$RID" '
  any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r
    and .labels == ["alpha","beta","gamma","prod","staging"])
' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' >/dev/null
```

### S144 Audit log records request labels in `data.labels`

The audit entry for a labelled request carries the extracted labels in
`data.labels`, with the prefix trimmed.

```bash
AUD_HDR="X-Qa-Audit-$QA_SUFFIX"
RID="qa-tag-audit-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$AUD_HDR\",\"prefix\":\"aud-\"}]}" >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -H "$AUD_HDR: aud-billing, aud-experiment" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_TAG_AUDIT_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' >/dev/null
AUDIT_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s144.audit.json"
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/audit/log?search=$RID&limit=3" > "$AUDIT_FILE"
  if jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r)' "$AUDIT_FILE" >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
jq -e --arg r "$RID" '
  any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and .data.labels == ["billing","experiment"])
' "$AUDIT_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' >/dev/null
```

### S145 Streaming chat records labels on the usage entry

Labels ride the shared stream observers, so a streamed completion records them
on its usage entry too.

```bash
STREAM_HDR="X-Qa-Stream-$QA_SUFFIX"
RID="qa-tag-stream-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$STREAM_HDR\"}]}" >/dev/null
STREAM_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s145.stream.log"
curl -fsSN "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -H "$STREAM_HDR: sse-check" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","stream":true,"stream_options":{"include_usage":true},"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_TAG_STREAM_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' \
  > "$STREAM_FILE"
grep -qF 'data: [DONE]' "$STREAM_FILE"
assert_chat_stream_has_usage "$STREAM_FILE"
USAGE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s145.usage.json"
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?search=$RID&limit=3" > "$USAGE_FILE"
  if jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
jq -e --arg r "$RID" '
  any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and .labels == ["sse-check"])
' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' >/dev/null
```

### S146 Usage labels are recorded on PostgreSQL and MongoDB backends

The tagging settings store and the usage `labels` column exist on all three
storage backends; this exercises the PostgreSQL and MongoDB gateways.

```bash
BACKEND_HDR="X-Qa-Backend-$QA_SUFFIX"
for TARGET in "$PG_BASE_URL|pg" "$MONGO_BASE_URL|mongo"; do
  URL="${TARGET%%|*}"
  TAG="${TARGET##*|}"
  RID="qa-tag-$TAG-$QA_SUFFIX"
  curl -fsS -X PUT "$URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"headers\":[{\"header\":\"$BACKEND_HDR\"}]}" \
    | jq -e --arg h "$BACKEND_HDR" 'any(.headers[]; (.header | ascii_downcase) == ($h | ascii_downcase))' >/dev/null
  curl -fsS "$URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
    -H "$BACKEND_HDR: $TAG-check" \
    -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_TAG_BACKEND_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' >/dev/null
  USAGE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s146.$TAG.usage.json"
  for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
    curl -fsS "$URL/admin/usage/log?search=$RID&limit=3" > "$USAGE_FILE"
    if jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null; then
      break
    fi
    sleep 1
  done
  jq -e --arg r "$RID" --arg l "$TAG-check" '
    any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and .labels == [$l])
  ' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null
  curl -fsS -X PUT "$URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' >/dev/null
done
```

### S147 No labels are recorded without a matching rule

With an empty operator rule set, a request carrying would-be label headers
records a usage entry without any `labels` field.

```bash
RID="qa-tag-norules-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"headers":[]}' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "X-Request-ID: $RID" \
  -H "X-Qa-Team-$QA_SUFFIX: team-alpha" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_TAG_NORULES_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' >/dev/null
USAGE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s147.usage.json"
for _ in $(seq 1 15); do
  curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/usage/log?search=$RID&limit=3" > "$USAGE_FILE"
  if jq -e --arg r "$RID" 'any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (.total_tokens // 0) > 0)' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null; then
    break
  fi
  sleep 1
done
jq -e --arg r "$RID" '
  any(.entries[]?; .request_id == $r and (has("labels") | not))
' "$USAGE_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S148 Tagging settings admin requires authentication

On the auth-enabled gateway the tagging settings endpoints are gated behind the
master key: an unauthenticated read is rejected with `401`, while the same read
with the admin bearer succeeds.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "401"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/tagging/settings" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  | jq -e '.editable == true and ((.headers // []) | type == "array")' >/dev/null
```


## 20. Post-v0.1.48 provider regressions

These scenarios cover providers rewired through the shared OpenAI-compatible
core (`#486`) and the new Fireworks provider (`#475`). DeepSeek scenarios use
`deepseek-flash`, a reasoning model that needs a generous `max_tokens`
budget before it emits final content.

### S149 DeepSeek non-streaming chat

Checks translated chat on DeepSeek through the shared OpenAI-compatible core.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s149.chat.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_DEEPSEEK_OK"}],"max_tokens":2000}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{model,provider,usage,answer:.choices[0].message.content}' "$RESP_FILE"
assert_chat_response_contains "$RESP_FILE" "deepseek" "QA_DEEPSEEK_OK"
```

### S150 DeepSeek streaming chat

Checks SSE chat streaming and the final usage chunk on DeepSeek.

```bash
SSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s150.chat.sse"
curl -fsS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-flash","stream":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_DEEPSEEK_STREAM_OK"}],"max_tokens":2000}' \
  > "$SSE_FILE"
sed -n '1,8p' "$SSE_FILE"
assert_chat_stream_contains "$SSE_FILE" "QA_DEEPSEEK_STREAM_OK"
assert_chat_stream_has_usage "$SSE_FILE"
```

### S151 Ollama local non-streaming chat

Checks translated chat against a local Ollama server through the shared
OpenAI-compatible core. Skips loudly when no chat-capable Ollama model is
registered (local server not running, or it only serves embedding models); any
gateway-side failure still fails the scenario.

```bash
OLLAMA_MODEL=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" \
  | jq -r '[.data[] | select((.id | startswith("ollama/")) and (((.metadata.modes // []) | index("chat")) != null)) | .id] | (map(select(endswith("qwen3:8b"))) + .)[0] // empty')
if [ -z "$OLLAMA_MODEL" ]; then
  echo "SKIPPED: no ollama chat models are registered (local Ollama server unavailable, or it serves embedding models only)" >&2
  exit 0
fi
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s151.chat.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$OLLAMA_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_OLLAMA_OK and nothing else. /no_think\"}],\"max_tokens\":600}" \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{model,provider,usage,answer:.choices[0].message.content}' "$RESP_FILE"
# The local model is whatever this machine has pulled, and a small one will not
# reliably echo a marker, so the assertion covers what the gateway owns —
# routing, translation, and usage — rather than instruction following.
jq -e '
  .object == "chat.completion"
  and .provider == "ollama"
  and (.model | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.choices[0].message.role == "assistant")
  and (.choices[0].message.content | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.usage.total_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S152 Ollama local streaming chat

Checks SSE chat streaming and the final usage chunk against local Ollama.

```bash
OLLAMA_MODEL=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" \
  | jq -r '[.data[] | select((.id | startswith("ollama/")) and (((.metadata.modes // []) | index("chat")) != null)) | .id] | (map(select(endswith("qwen3:8b"))) + .)[0] // empty')
if [ -z "$OLLAMA_MODEL" ]; then
  echo "SKIPPED: no ollama chat models are registered (local Ollama server unavailable, or it serves embedding models only)" >&2
  exit 0
fi
SSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s152.chat.sse"
curl -fsS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$OLLAMA_MODEL\",\"stream\":true,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_OLLAMA_STREAM_OK and nothing else. /no_think\"}],\"max_tokens\":600}" \
  > "$SSE_FILE"
sed -n '1,8p' "$SSE_FILE"
# As in S151, the marker is not asserted: the stream shape, a non-empty
# assembled delta, a terminal finish_reason, and the final usage chunk are.
grep -qF 'data: [DONE]' "$SSE_FILE"
grep '^data: {' "$SSE_FILE" | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | jq -s -e '
      any(.[]; .object == "chat.completion.chunk")
      and ([.[]?.choices[]?.delta.content? // empty] | join("") | length > 0)
      and any(.[]; (.choices[]?.finish_reason? // "") != "")
    ' >/dev/null
assert_chat_stream_has_usage "$SSE_FILE"
```

### S153 Fireworks non-streaming chat

Checks translated chat on the Fireworks provider. The provider must always be
registered; when the upstream account itself is unavailable (suspension,
billing) the scenario skips loudly instead of failing the release gate on an
external billing state.

```bash
STATUS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s153.fireworks-status.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/providers/status" > "$STATUS_FILE"
jq -e '.providers[] | select(.name == "fireworks") | .runtime.registered == true' "$STATUS_FILE" >/dev/null
if jq -e '.providers[] | select(.name == "fireworks") | (.status != "healthy") and ((.last_error // "") | test("suspend|billing|payment|quota"; "i"))' "$STATUS_FILE" >/dev/null; then
  echo "SKIPPED: fireworks upstream account is unavailable (billing/suspension)" >&2
  exit 0
fi
FIREWORKS_MODEL=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" \
  | jq -er '[.data[].id | select(startswith("fireworks/"))] | (map(select(test("llama-v3p1-8b-instruct$"))) + .)[0]')
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s153.chat.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$FIREWORKS_MODEL\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_FIREWORKS_OK\"}],\"max_tokens\":2000}" \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{model,provider,usage,answer:.choices[0].message.content}' "$RESP_FILE"
assert_chat_response_contains "$RESP_FILE" "fireworks" "QA_FIREWORKS_OK"
```

### S154 Fireworks streaming chat

Checks SSE chat streaming and the final usage chunk on Fireworks, with the
same loud skip when the upstream account is unavailable.

```bash
STATUS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s154.fireworks-status.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/providers/status" > "$STATUS_FILE"
jq -e '.providers[] | select(.name == "fireworks") | .runtime.registered == true' "$STATUS_FILE" >/dev/null
if jq -e '.providers[] | select(.name == "fireworks") | (.status != "healthy") and ((.last_error // "") | test("suspend|billing|payment|quota"; "i"))' "$STATUS_FILE" >/dev/null; then
  echo "SKIPPED: fireworks upstream account is unavailable (billing/suspension)" >&2
  exit 0
fi
FIREWORKS_MODEL=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" \
  | jq -er '[.data[].id | select(startswith("fireworks/"))] | (map(select(test("llama-v3p1-8b-instruct$"))) + .)[0]')
SSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s154.chat.sse"
curl -fsS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$FIREWORKS_MODEL\",\"stream\":true,\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"Reply with exactly QA_FIREWORKS_STREAM_OK\"}],\"max_tokens\":2000}" \
  > "$SSE_FILE"
sed -n '1,8p' "$SSE_FILE"
assert_chat_stream_contains "$SSE_FILE" "QA_FIREWORKS_STREAM_OK"
assert_chat_stream_has_usage "$SSE_FILE"
```

## 21. Scoped rate limits

These scenarios cover the scoped rate-limit feature (`#482`): admin CRUD with
validation, user-path request and token enforcement, model-scope saturation,
and auth gating. Rules created here are deleted at the end of each scenario.

### S155 Rate limit admin CRUD and validation

Creates a harmless high provider-scope rule, verifies it is listed, checks

### S156 User-path request limit enforcement

Creates a one-request-per-minute rule on a QA path, verifies the first request
passes with `x-ratelimit-*` headers, the second returns `429` with
`Retry-After` and `code: rate_limit_exceeded`, and that `reset-one` unblocks
the path again.

```bash
RL_PATH="/qa/ratelimit/requests/$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s156.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s156.body.json"

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" \

  | jq -e --arg p "$RL_PATH" 'all(.rate_limits[]?; .user_path != $p)' >/dev/null
```

### S157 User-path token limit is post-accounted from usage

Creates a one-token-per-minute rule, verifies the first request passes (token
windows admit while the window has remaining budget and are charged from usage
entries afterwards), waits for the charge to land on the rule counters, and
verifies the next request is blocked with token rate-limit headers.

```bash
RL_PATH="/qa/ratelimit/tokens/$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s157.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s157.body.json"
RULES_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s157.rules.json"

```

### S158 Model-scope saturation returns 429 without alternatives

Pins `deepseek/deepseek-flash` to one request per minute; the second direct
request has no alternative provider for the model and must be rejected with
`429` instead of routed elsewhere. Leaves the model saturated for up to one
minute after the scenario runs.

```bash
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s158.body.json"

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"scope":"model","subject":"deepseek/deepseek-flash","limit_key":{"period":"minute"},"max_requests":1}' \
  | jq -e 'any(.rate_limits[]?; .scope == "model" and .subject == "deepseek/deepseek-flash" and .max_requests == 1)' >/dev/null

  | jq -e 'all(.rate_limits[]?; .subject != "deepseek/deepseek-flash")' >/dev/null
```

### S159 Rate limit admin requires authentication

On the auth-enabled gateway the rate-limit admin endpoints are gated behind
the master key.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "401"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" \
  | jq -e '(.rate_limits | type == "array") and (.server_time | type == "string")' >/dev/null
```

## 22. Responses and conversations persistence

These scenarios cover `/v1/conversations` CRUD and the persistence of
responses/conversations snapshots to the configured storage backend (`#488`),
plus the rewrite-savings usage summary fields (`#481`).

### S160 Conversations lifecycle CRUD

Creates a conversation with seed items and metadata, reads it back, updates
the metadata, deletes it, and verifies the read-after-delete returns `404`.

```bash
CONV_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s160.conversation.json"
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/conversations" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"metadata\":{\"suite\":\"qa-release-$QA_SUFFIX\"},\"items\":[{\"type\":\"message\",\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":[{\"type\":\"input_text\",\"text\":\"qa conversation seed\"}]}]}" \
  > "$CONV_FILE"
jq '.' "$CONV_FILE"
jq -e --arg suite "qa-release-$QA_SUFFIX" '
  .object == "conversation"
  and (.id | type == "string" and startswith("conv_"))
  and (.created_at | type == "number")
  and .metadata.suite == $suite
' "$CONV_FILE" >/dev/null
CONV_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$CONV_FILE")

curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
  | jq -e --arg id "$CONV_ID" --arg suite "qa-release-$QA_SUFFIX" '.id == $id and .object == "conversation" and .metadata.suite == $suite' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"metadata\":{\"suite\":\"qa-release-$QA_SUFFIX-updated\"}}" \
  | jq -e --arg suite "qa-release-$QA_SUFFIX-updated" '.metadata.suite == $suite' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
  | jq -e --arg id "$CONV_ID" '.id == $id and .object == "conversation.deleted" and .deleted == true' >/dev/null

BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s160.after-delete.json"
curl -sS -o "$BODY_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "404"' >/dev/null
jq -e '.error.type == "not_found_error"' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S161 Responses and conversations persist on PostgreSQL and MongoDB

Creates a stored response and a conversation on the PostgreSQL and MongoDB
gateways, reads both back, and cleans up. This covers the persistent
responses/conversations stores added for the non-SQLite backends.

```bash
for TARGET in "$PG_BASE_URL|pg" "$MONGO_BASE_URL|mongo"; do
  URL="${TARGET%%|*}"
  TAG="${TARGET##*|}"

  CONV_ID=$(curl -fsS -X POST "$URL/v1/conversations" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"metadata\":{\"backend\":\"$TAG-$QA_SUFFIX\"}}" | jq -er '.id')

  RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s161.$TAG.response.json"
  curl -fsS "$URL/v1/responses" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"model\":\"gpt-4.1-nano\",\"input\":\"Reply with exactly QA_PERSIST_${TAG}_OK\",\"max_output_tokens\":20}" \
    > "$RESP_FILE"
  assert_responses_response_contains "$RESP_FILE" "openai" "QA_PERSIST_${TAG}_OK"
  RESP_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$RESP_FILE")

  curl -fsS "$URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
    | jq -e --arg b "$TAG-$QA_SUFFIX" '.object == "conversation" and .metadata.backend == $b' >/dev/null
  curl -fsS "$URL/v1/responses/$RESP_ID" > "$RESP_FILE.retrieved"
  jq -e --arg id "$RESP_ID" --arg marker "QA_PERSIST_${TAG}_OK" '
    .id == $id and .object == "response" and .status == "completed"
    and any(.output[]?.content[]?; .type == "output_text" and (.text | contains($marker)))
  ' "$RESP_FILE.retrieved" >/dev/null

  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$URL/v1/responses/$RESP_ID" \
    | jq -e --arg id "$RESP_ID" '.id == $id and .object == "response.deleted" and .deleted == true' >/dev/null
  curl -fsS -X DELETE "$URL/v1/conversations/$CONV_ID" \
    | jq -e --arg id "$CONV_ID" '.id == $id and .deleted == true' >/dev/null
done
```

### S162 Usage summary exposes rewrite savings fields

The usage summary carries the rewrite-savings aggregates on every storage
backend; without a registered request rewriter the token counter is zero.

```bash
for URL in "$BASE_URL" "$PG_BASE_URL" "$MONGO_BASE_URL"; do
  curl -fsS "$URL/admin/usage/summary" \
    | jq -e '
        has("rewrite_tokens_saved")
        and (.rewrite_tokens_saved | type == "number")
        and (.rewrite_tokens_saved >= 0)
        and has("rewrite_cost_saved")
      ' >/dev/null
done
```

## 23. MCP gateway and provider request health

These scenarios cover the post-v0.1.51 features: the aggregating MCP gateway
(PR #502), JSON-RPC body capture on MCP audit entries (PR #534), and
real-traffic `request_health` on provider status (PR #521). They need the mock
MCP upstream on port 18090 (started by `manage-release-e2e-stack.sh`).

### S163 Admin MCP server CRUD with secret redaction and catalog inspector

Registers the token-gated alpha and open beta upstreams, checks the admin
view (headers redacted as `***`, connection state, tool counts), reads the
per-server catalog, and deletes both.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"
  exit 0
fi

      and .tool_count == 2 and .prompt_count == 1 and .resource_count == 1

  | jq -e --arg a "$QA_MCP_ALPHA" --arg b "$QA_MCP_BETA" 'all(.[]?; .name != $a and .name != $b)' >/dev/null
```

### S164 Aggregated /mcp initialize with merged instructions and namespaced tools

Runs the streamable-HTTP handshake against `/mcp` with plain curl and checks
that upstream instructions are merged into the gateway `initialize` result and
that `tools/list` exposes deterministic `{server}_{tool}` names.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"
  exit 0
fi

' "$TOOLS_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S165 tools/call by namespaced and bare name plus MCP usage entries

Calls one tool through the aggregated endpoint using its namespaced name and
another using its unique bare name, then checks the usage entry written for
the call (`provider="mcp"`, `provider_name`=server, `model`=namespaced tool).

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"
  exit 0
fi

### S167 MCP audit entries carry JSON-RPC bodies and nosniff

With `LOGGING_LOG_BODIES` on, an MCP `tools/call` audit entry is labelled with
the tool name and `provider="mcp"`, and captures both the JSON-RPC request
frame and the SSE-decoded response frame. The list projection omits bodies
(`bodies_omitted: true`), so the frames are asserted through
`/admin/audit/detail`. The MCP response also carries
`X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"

### S168 MCP negatives: unknown server, unknown tool, session identity binding, header-principal enforcement, stdio rejected

Unknown per-server endpoints 404, an unknown tool returns a JSON-RPC error,
a session initialized by one user path is invisible to another principal,
header-identified MCP posts are gated by user-path rate limits, `user_paths`
server scoping admits subtree members and hides the server from outsiders,
and the admin API rejects runtime-registered stdio servers.

### S169 Secret *** round-trip preserves the stored header; a wrong secret breaks the dial

Re-upserting the token-gated server with the redaction placeholder must keep
the stored `X-Mock-Token`, so the reconnect still succeeds; upserting a wrong
token must leave the server unable to connect.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"

### S170 Provider request health folded into /admin/providers/status

After real chat traffic the provider status carries `request_health`: a
10-minute window of per-model request counts plus the circuit-breaker state.

### S171 MCP server store parity on PostgreSQL and MongoDB

The `mcp_servers` admin store round-trips on both non-SQLite backends, and a
registered server serves tool calls through each gateway.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"
  exit 0

### S172 Namespaced prompts and resources relay through /mcp

Prompts are namespaced like tools; resources and resource templates relay
verbatim, and `resources/read` returns the upstream payload.

```bash
if ! curl -fsS "$MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE/healthz" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  echo "SKIPPED: mock MCP upstream is not running on $MCP_UPSTREAM_BASE"
  exit 0

## 24. Anthropic Messages drop-in compatibility

These scenarios cover the gaps closed by the Anthropic-SDK drop-in fix pass:
`x-api-key` auth fallback, `stop_sequence` surfaced as a typed field, seeded
`message_start` usage on streams, dialect-aware `/v1/models`, and a canonical
404 envelope that no longer swallows 405s. `S173`-`S175` run on the
auth-enabled gateway (`$AUTH_BASE_URL`) since the auth fallback needs a
gateway with a master key configured; the rest run on `$BASE_URL`, which runs
in unsafe mode. All are read-mostly and rerunnable in any order.

### S173 `x-api-key` header authenticates like `Authorization: Bearer`

Checks the Anthropic-native credential header works unchanged, matching
`Anthropic(api_key=...)` SDK defaults.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s173.chat.json"
curl -fsS "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "x-api-key: $GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_XAPIKEY_OK"}],"max_tokens":20}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
assert_chat_response_contains "$RESP_FILE" "openai" "QA_XAPIKEY_OK"
```

### S174 Missing credentials names both accepted schemes (negative)

Checks the combined error message added when neither header is present.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s174.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s174.body"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 401 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "authentication_error" and (.error.message | test("Authorization: Bearer") and test("x-api-key"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S175 `Authorization` takes precedence over `x-api-key` when both are sent

A wrong bearer token is still rejected even when a valid `x-api-key` is also
present, confirming the fallback only applies when `Authorization` is absent.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s175.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s175.body"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer totally-wrong-key' \
  -H "x-api-key: $GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY" \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}'
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 401 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
```

### S176 `stop_sequence` surfaces as a typed field (non-streaming, Anthropic backend)

Checks the natively reported matched sequence round-trips through
`/v1/messages` as `stop_reason: "stop_sequence"` plus `stop_sequence`.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s176.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":64,"stop_sequences":["QA_STOP_HERE"],"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Count from 1 to 10, one number per line. After the number 3 write the exact text QA_STOP_HERE then continue."}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{stop_reason,stop_sequence}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.stop_reason == "stop_sequence" and .stop_sequence == "QA_STOP_HERE"' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S177 `stop_sequence` in streaming `message_delta` plus seeded `message_start` usage

Checks the streaming counterpart of `S176` and that `message_start` no longer
reports a hardcoded zero for `usage.input_tokens`.

```bash
SSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s177.messages.sse"
curl -fsS --no-buffer "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":64,"stream":true,"stop_sequences":["QA_STOP_HERE"],"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Count from 1 to 10, one number per line. After the number 3 write the exact text QA_STOP_HERE then continue."}]}' \
  > "$SSE_FILE"
grep -A1 '^event: message_start' "$SSE_FILE" | sed -n '2p' | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | jq -e '.message.usage.input_tokens > 0' >/dev/null
grep -A1 '^event: message_delta' "$SSE_FILE" | sed -n '2p' | sed 's/^data: //' \
  | jq -e '.delta.stop_reason == "stop_sequence" and .delta.stop_sequence == "QA_STOP_HERE"' >/dev/null
```

### S178 OpenAI-family backend keeps `end_turn` through `/v1/messages` (documented limitation)

`finish_reason: "stop"` conflates a natural stop with a stop-sequence hit, so
OpenAI-family providers structurally cannot report `stop_sequence`; checks the
gateway keeps `end_turn` rather than fabricating a value.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s178.messages.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":64,"stop_sequences":["QA_STOP_HERE"],"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Count from 1 to 10, one number per line. After the number 3 write the exact text QA_STOP_HERE then continue."}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{stop_reason,stop_sequence}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.stop_reason == "end_turn" and .stop_sequence == null' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S179 `GET /v1/models` renders the Anthropic shape for Anthropic SDK clients

The Anthropic SDK always sends `anthropic-version`; checks the response takes
the Anthropic list shape (`type`, `display_name`, `created_at`,
`has_more`/`first_id`/`last_id`) instead of the OpenAI shape.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s179.models.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01' > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{sample: .data[0], has_more, first_id, last_id}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '
    (.data | length) > 0
    and .data[0].type == "model"
    and (.data[0].display_name | type == "string")
    and (.data[0] | has("object") | not)
    and .has_more == false
    and (.first_id != null)
    and (.last_id != null)
  ' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S180 `GET /v1/models` stays OpenAI-shaped without the header (regression)

Checks the default OpenAI-compatible listing shape is unchanged for callers
that do not send `anthropic-version`.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s180.models.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/models" > "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.object == "list" and (.data[0].object == "model")' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S181 Unknown route 404 renders in the caller's wire dialect

Checks the canonical 404 envelope added for unclassified routes: Anthropic
shape when `anthropic-version` is present, gateway/OpenAI shape otherwise.

```bash
ANTHROPIC_BODY="$QA_RUN_DIR/s181.anthropic.json"
DEFAULT_BODY="$QA_RUN_DIR/s181.default.json"
curl -sS -o "$ANTHROPIC_BODY" -w '%{http_code}\n' "$BASE_URL/v1/does-not-exist" -H 'anthropic-version: 2023-06-01'
curl -sS -o "$DEFAULT_BODY" -w '%{http_code}\n' "$BASE_URL/v1/does-not-exist"
jq '.' "$ANTHROPIC_BODY"
jq '.' "$DEFAULT_BODY"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "not_found_error"' "$ANTHROPIC_BODY" >/dev/null
jq -e '(.type != "error") and .error.type == "not_found_error"' "$DEFAULT_BODY" >/dev/null
```

### S182 Known route with the wrong method still returns 405 (regression)

The dialect-aware 404 handler is registered as the router-level
`NotFoundHandler`, not a wildcard route, specifically so it does not shadow
echo's 405 method-not-allowed handling for routes that do exist.

```bash
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s182.headers"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o /dev/null -X GET "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 405 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
```

## 25. Anthropic Message Batches API

These scenarios exercise `/v1/messages/batches*`, the Anthropic-dialect ingress
over the same native-batch pipeline that serves `/v1/batches`. A batch's
requests are translated per-item to canonical chat requests, so a Message
Batch can route to any provider with native batch support, not only
Anthropic. Batch IDs are pure prefix aliases of one underlying resource:
`msgbatch_<uuid>` on this dialect, `batch_<uuid>` on `/v1/batches`. Real
provider batches can take a long time to complete, so these scenarios check
create/get/list/cancel/delete-guard/validation behavior rather than waiting
for a batch to end; `S183`-`S191` are self-contained and rerunnable in any
order but leave `in_progress`/`canceling` batches behind, like `S47`-`S48`.

### S183 Create a native Anthropic Message Batch

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s183.batch.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-msgbatch-anthropic-1","params":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MSGBATCH_ANTHROPIC_OK"}]}}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{id,type,processing_status,request_counts}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "message_batch" and (.id | startswith("msgbatch_")) and (.processing_status | type == "string")' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
echo "$(jq -r .id "$RESP_FILE")" > "$QA_RUN_DIR/s183.batch-id"
```

### S184 Create a Message Batch routed to an OpenAI model (cross-provider)

Checks the Anthropic Message Batches dialect is provider-agnostic like
`/v1/messages`: an OpenAI model batch is created and materialized into an
uploaded JSONL input file under the hood.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s184.batch.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-msgbatch-openai-1","params":{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MSGBATCH_OPENAI_OK"}]}}]}' \
  > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{id,type,processing_status}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "message_batch" and (.id | startswith("msgbatch_"))' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
echo "$(jq -r .id "$RESP_FILE")" > "$QA_RUN_DIR/s184.batch-id"
```

### S185 Get and list Message Batches

```bash
BATCH_ID=$(cat "$QA_RUN_DIR/s183.batch-id")
GET_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s185.get.json"
LIST_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s185.list.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches/$BATCH_ID" > "$GET_FILE"
jq -e --arg id "$BATCH_ID" '.id == $id and .type == "message_batch" and (.expires_at | type == "string")' "$GET_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches?limit=20" > "$LIST_FILE"
jq '{has_more,first_id,last_id,count:(.data|length)}' "$LIST_FILE"
jq -e --arg id "$BATCH_ID" '[.data[].id] | index($id) != null' "$LIST_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S186 Message Batch IDs are dialect aliases of `/v1/batches` resources

Checks the `msgbatch_`/`batch_` prefix aliasing holds in both directions: a
batch created on one dialect is retrievable on the other under the mapped ID.

```bash
BATCH_ID=$(cat "$QA_RUN_DIR/s183.batch-id")
ALIASED_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s186.aliased.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/batches/batch_${BATCH_ID#msgbatch_}" > "$ALIASED_FILE"
jq -e --arg id "batch_${BATCH_ID#msgbatch_}" '.id == $id and .object == "batch" and .provider == "anthropic"' "$ALIASED_FILE" >/dev/null

CREATE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s186.create.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"endpoint":"/v1/chat/completions","requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-reverse-alias-1","method":"POST","url":"/v1/chat/completions","body":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_REVERSE_BATCH_OK"}],"max_tokens":32}}]}' \
  > "$CREATE_FILE"
NATIVE_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$CREATE_FILE")
REVERSE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s186.reverse.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches/msgbatch_${NATIVE_ID#batch_}" > "$REVERSE_FILE"
jq -e --arg id "msgbatch_${NATIVE_ID#batch_}" '.id == $id and .type == "message_batch"' "$REVERSE_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S187 Cancel a Message Batch

```bash
BATCH_ID=$(cat "$QA_RUN_DIR/s184.batch-id")
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s187.cancel.json"
curl -fsS -X POST "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches/$BATCH_ID/cancel" > "$RESP_FILE"
jq '{id,processing_status,cancel_initiated_at}' "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e --arg id "$BATCH_ID" '.id == $id and (.processing_status == "canceling" or .processing_status == "ended")' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S188 Delete guard rejects a still-processing Message Batch (negative)

Batches still processing must be canceled first, matching the Anthropic
Message Batches contract. The scenario submits its own batch and tries to
delete it immediately, rather than reusing `S183`'s, so the batch cannot have
ended in the meantime; if the upstream reports it ended anyway, the guard has
nothing to reject and the scenario skips loudly.

```bash
CREATE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s188.create.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-msgbatch-delete-guard","params":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MSGBATCH_DELETE_GUARD"}]}}]}' \
  > "$CREATE_FILE"
BATCH_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$CREATE_FILE")
if [ "$(jq -r '.processing_status' "$CREATE_FILE")" = "ended" ]; then
  echo "SKIPPED: batch $BATCH_ID already ended, so the delete guard does not apply" >&2
  exit 0
fi
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s188.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s188.body"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches/$BATCH_ID"
cat "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.type == "error" and .error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("still processing"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S189 Message Batch create validation negatives

```bash
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s189.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s189.body"

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"requests":[]}'
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"dup","params":{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"a"}]}},{"custom_id":"dup","params":{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"b"}]}}]}'
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.message | test("not unique")' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"  ","params":{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":10,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"a"}]}}]}'
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.message | test("required")' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S190 Message Batch results before ready returns the not-ready envelope (negative)

Like `S188`, this submits its own batch and reads results immediately, so the
batch is still processing when the envelope is checked.

```bash
CREATE_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s190.create.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-msgbatch-not-ready","params":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":32,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Reply with exactly QA_MSGBATCH_NOT_READY"}]}}]}' \
  > "$CREATE_FILE"
BATCH_ID=$(jq -er '.id' "$CREATE_FILE")
if [ "$(jq -r '.processing_status' "$CREATE_FILE")" = "ended" ]; then
  echo "SKIPPED: batch $BATCH_ID already ended, so results are ready" >&2
  exit 0
fi
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s190.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s190.body"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches/$BATCH_ID/results"
cat "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 409 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("not ready"))' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S191 Mixed-provider requests in one Message Batch are rejected (negative)

A single native batch is submitted to one upstream provider; checks a batch
mixing an Anthropic and an OpenAI model item is rejected before submission,
the same discipline as the file-based `/v1/batches` mixed-provider check
(`S48`).

```bash
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s191.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s191.body"
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/messages/batches" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"requests":[{"custom_id":"qa-mixed-a","params":{"model":"claude-sonnet-4-6","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}},{"custom_id":"qa-mixed-b","params":{"model":"gpt-4.1-nano","max_tokens":16,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}]}}]}'
cat "$BODY_FILE"
grep -Eiq '^HTTP/.* 400 ' "$HEADERS_FILE"
jq -e '.error.message | test("single provider per batch")' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null
```

## 26. Dashboard-managed provider credentials

These scenarios cover the admin provider-credentials store
(`/admin/provider-credentials` GET/PUT/DELETE + `/types`) that lets an operator
register, edit, disable, and remove model providers from the dashboard without
env vars or a restart. Each scenario registers `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped provider
names, asserts secret redaction and hot-registration into the live routing
catalog, and deletes what it created, so they are self-contained and rerunnable
in any order. Managed (config/env-declared) providers stay read-only, which the
negatives assert. The store is exercised on SQLite (`$BASE_URL`), and its
PostgreSQL/MongoDB parity plus the auth-enabled gateway are covered by their own
scenarios below.

### S192 Provider-credential CRUD with secret redaction and hot-registration

Creates an `openai`-type store provider with an API key and an inline model,
confirms the secret is redacted on read while the entry stays `managed:false`,
that the inline model hot-registers into `/admin/models` under the new
provider, and that re-submitting the all-asterisk mask preserves the stored key.

```bash
PC_NAME="qa-cred-$QA_SUFFIX"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s192.body.json"

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"openai\",\"api_keys\":[\"sk-qa-secret-$QA_SUFFIX\"],\"base_url\":\"https://example.invalid/v1\",\"models\":[\"qa-cred-model-$QA_SUFFIX\"]}" \
  > "$BODY_FILE"
jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" --arg m "qa-cred-model-$QA_SUFFIX" '
  .name == $n and .type == "openai" and .managed == false and .enabled == true
  and (.api_keys | length == 1 and .[0] == "***********")
  and (.base_url == "https://example.invalid/v1")
  and (.models | index($m) != null)
' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" 'any(.[]?; .name == $n and .managed == false and (.api_keys[0] == "***********"))' >/dev/null

curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/models" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" --arg m "qa-cred-model-$QA_SUFFIX" 'any(.[]?; .provider_name == $n and .model.id == $m)' >/dev/null

# Re-submitting the mask preserves the stored key (older dashboards send "***").
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"openai\",\"api_keys\":[\"***********\"],\"base_url\":\"https://example.invalid/v1\",\"models\":[\"qa-cred-model-$QA_SUFFIX\"]}" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" '.name == $n and (.api_keys[0] == "***********")' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials/$PC_NAME" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "204"' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" 'all(.[]?; .name != $n)' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/models" \
  | jq -e --arg m "qa-cred-model-$QA_SUFFIX" 'all(.[]?; .model.id != $m)' >/dev/null
```

### S193 Disabling a stored provider unregisters it from routing

A keyless `ollama`-type provider with an inline model registers into
`/admin/models`; setting `enabled:false` keeps the stored row but drops it from
the routing catalog, and re-enabling restores it.

```bash
PC_NAME="qa-cred-off-$QA_SUFFIX"
PC_MODEL="qa-cred-off-model-$QA_SUFFIX"

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"ollama\",\"base_url\":\"http://127.0.0.1:59999\",\"models\":[\"$PC_MODEL\"]}" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" '.name == $n and .enabled == true' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/models" \
  | jq -e --arg m "$PC_MODEL" 'any(.[]?; .model.id == $m)' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"ollama\",\"base_url\":\"http://127.0.0.1:59999\",\"models\":[\"$PC_MODEL\"],\"enabled\":false}" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" '.name == $n and .enabled == false' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" 'any(.[]?; .name == $n and .enabled == false)' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/models" \
  | jq -e --arg m "$PC_MODEL" 'all(.[]?; .model.id != $m)' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"ollama\",\"base_url\":\"http://127.0.0.1:59999\",\"models\":[\"$PC_MODEL\"],\"enabled\":true}" \
  | jq -e '.enabled == true' >/dev/null
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/models" \
  | jq -e --arg m "$PC_MODEL" 'any(.[]?; .model.id == $m)' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -o /dev/null -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials/$PC_NAME"
```

### S194 Provider-credential validation and read-only negatives

Covers the guardrails: a config/env-declared provider is read-only for both
PUT and DELETE, an unknown type and a name containing `/` are rejected, a
redacted API key with no stored value to preserve is rejected, a credential
missing a field its provider type requires is rejected without being stored,
and deleting an absent provider returns 404. Every rejection names the
offending field in `error.param`.

```bash
MANAGED_NAME=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" | jq -er 'map(select(.managed)) | .[0].name')
MANAGED_TYPE=$(curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" | jq -er --arg n "$MANAGED_NAME" '.[] | select(.name == $n) | .type')
HEADERS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s194.headers"
BODY_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s194.body"

# Managed provider PUT is read-only (400).
curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \

  | jq -R -e '. == "404"' >/dev/null
```

### S195 Provider-credential store parity on PostgreSQL and MongoDB

The provider-credentials store round-trips on both non-SQLite backends: create,
list with redaction, and delete.

```bash
PC_NAME="qa-cred-parity-$QA_SUFFIX"

for URL in "$PG_BASE_URL" "$MONGO_BASE_URL"; do
  curl -fsS -X PUT "$URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"name\":\"$PC_NAME\",\"type\":\"openai\",\"api_keys\":[\"sk-qa-parity-$QA_SUFFIX\"],\"models\":[\"qa-cred-parity-model-$QA_SUFFIX\"]}" \
    | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" '.name == $n and .managed == false and (.api_keys[0] == "***********")' >/dev/null

  curl -fsS "$URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
    | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" 'any(.[]?; .name == $n and .managed == false and (.api_keys[0] == "***********"))' >/dev/null

  curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' -X DELETE "$URL/admin/provider-credentials/$PC_NAME" \
    | jq -R -e '. == "204"' >/dev/null
  curl -fsS "$URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
    | jq -e --arg n "$PC_NAME" 'all(.[]?; .name != $n)' >/dev/null
done
```

### S196 Provider-credentials require admin auth; declared providers are managed

On the auth-enabled gateway the endpoints reject unauthenticated reads (401) and
serve authenticated ones, the `/types` catalog lists constructible provider
types with the credential fields each one accepts (Vertex takes no API key),
and env/config-declared providers surface as read-only `managed:true` rows.

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}' "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  | jq -R -e '. == "401"' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials/types" \
  | jq -e 'type == "array"
      and (map(.type) | index("openai") != null and index("anthropic") != null)
      and (map(select(.type == "openai")) | first | .fields | map(.name) | index("api_keys") != null)
      and (map(select(.type == "vertex")) | first | .fields | map(.name) | (index("api_keys") == null and index("vertex_project") != null))' >/dev/null

curl -fsS -H "$ADMIN_AUTH_HEADER" "$AUTH_BASE_URL/admin/provider-credentials" \
  | jq -e 'type == "array" and any(.[]?; .managed == true)' >/dev/null
```

## 27. Budgets scoped to labels

These scenarios exercise scoping a budget to a request label (`scope: "label"`)
rather than a `user_path` subtree. Every label is `$QA_SUFFIX`-scoped and every
scenario deletes the budgets it created. How a label reaches the request varies:
S198, S199, S201 and S203 configure a tagging header and restore an empty rule
set afterwards; S200 uses the labels on the managed key that authenticated the
request and needs no tagging rule at all; S197 and S204 are admin-only and send
no model traffic.

Each scenario that depends on starting from zero spend calls
`reset_release_budget` right after creating its budget, so a rerun following a
part-way failure — which skips the failed scenario's cleanup — does not inherit
the previous run's spend. Together that makes them self-contained and rerunnable
in any order.

### S197 Label budget admin CRUD and validation negatives

A label-scoped budget round-trips through the admin API with no `user_path`
field in its response, and the request is rejected when the scope/subject
combination is invalid.

```bash
QA_LBL="QaBudgetLabel-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s197.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s197.body.XXXXXX")

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"scope\":\"label\",\"subject\":\"$QA_LBL\",\"budget_key\":{\"period\":\"daily\"},\"amount\":25.5}" \
  | jq -e --arg l "$QA_LBL" '
      any(.budgets[]?; .scope == "label" and .subject == $l and .amount == 25.5 and .source == "manual" and (has("user_path") | not))
    ' >/dev/null

curl -sS -D "$HEADERS_FILE" -o "$BODY_FILE" -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/budgets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"scope\":\"label\",\"subject\":\"$QA_LBL\",\"user_path\":\"/qa-conflict\",\"budget_key\":{\"period\":\"daily\"},\"amount\":5}"

```

### S198 Label budget blocks a request once exhausted, matched verbatim

A tagging rule extracts a label header onto the request; a tiny label budget
lets the first request through and records spend, then blocks a second request
carrying the same label with a `budget_exceeded` 429. A third request carrying
a different-case spelling of the label is not blocked, since label matching
never folds case.

```bash

### S199 A request carrying several labels is charged against every matching budget

Two label budgets exist; a single request carrying both labels records spend
on both in one lookup, and a later request that would breach only one of them
is still blocked, naming the exhausted label rather than the healthy one.

### S200 A managed API key's labels charge a label budget without any tagging header

Labels attached to the managed key that authenticated the request are merged
into the request's labels the same way header-extracted labels are, so a
label budget matches even when no tagging rule is configured. This runs on the
auth-enabled gateway (which already requires a master key for every request)
rather than the main SQLite gateway: on a gateway with no `GOMODEL_MASTER_KEY`,
creating a managed key switches every endpoint, including `/v1/*`, to require
bearer auth from then on, and managed keys have no delete endpoint (only
`deactivate`, which does not undo the switch since it counts stored keys, not
active ones) — so registering one on the open gateway would leave it
permanently locked down for every later scenario. The auth-enabled gateway
also has the exact response cache on, so both chat replies are suffixed with
`$QA_BUDGET_SUFFIX`: a fixed reply string would be served from a prior run's
cached response on a rerun, bypassing usage tracking entirely and making the
budget never show spend (response cache hits return before budget/usage
enforcement by design).

```bash

### S201 A request matching both a user_path and a label budget is blocked by whichever is exhausted

One generous `user_path` budget and one tiny `label` budget both match the
same request; once the label budget is exhausted, the request is blocked even
though the user-path budget still has ample room, and the error names the
exhausted label rather than the path.

## 25. Rate limit counters across reload

These scenarios cover request-window persistence across `gomodel --reload`
(SIGHUP). Hour windows so the cap outlives the reload wait. Shared
user-path rules only — the OSS release stack has no `quota_templates`
entitlement.

### S205 Request-window counters survive `--reload` (SQLite)

Creates a one-request-per-hour rule, burns it, reloads `sqlite-main`, and
verifies the next request is still `429`.

```bash
RL_PATH="/qa/ratelimit/persist/$QA_SUFFIX"

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" \

### S206 `reset-one` stays cleared across `--reload`

Burns an hour window, resets it, reloads, and verifies the next request
succeeds.

```bash

curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/rate-limits" \

### S207 Request-window counters survive `--reload` on PostgreSQL and MongoDB

Same as S205 against the smoke gateways.

```bash

```

## 28. Images API

These scenarios exercise the OpenAI-compatible image endpoints
(`POST /v1/images/generations`, `POST /v1/images/edits`) on the main SQLite
gateway, across OpenAI and Gemini's native API. They are self-contained
(`S210` creates and deletes its own alias) and rerunnable in any order. Edits
upload `$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE` from the common setup, so no scenario depends on
another's output.

### S208 Generate an image on OpenAI

Checks `POST /v1/images/generations`: a JSON request returns the OpenAI images
envelope with inline base64 pixels, the `provider` field GoModel adds, and the
token usage `gpt-image-1`-family models report.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s208.images.json"
HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$RESP_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gpt-image-1-mini","prompt":"a small red circle centered on a white background","n":1,"size":"1024x1024","quality":"low"}')
jq '{created,provider,size,quality,usage,data_count:(.data|length)}' "$RESP_FILE"
[ "$HTTP" = "200" ]
jq -e '
  (.created | type == "number")
  and .provider == "openai"
  and (.data | length) == 1
  and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.usage.total_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
assert_png_from_b64_json "$RESP_FILE" 0 "$QA_RUN_DIR/s208.png"
```

### S209 Generate an image through Gemini's native API

Checks that a Gemini image model generates through the native
`generateContent` API behind the same OpenAI-shaped endpoint: images always come
back as `b64_json`, and Gemini image models report token usage.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s209.images.json"
# A Gemini image model sometimes answers a generation prompt with text only,
# which the gateway surfaces as `502 Gemini returned no images`. Retry a couple
# of times so the scenario fails on a broken path, not on model variance.
HTTP=000
for _ in $(seq 1 3); do
  HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$RESP_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"model":"gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image","prompt":"Generate an image: a solid red circle centered on a plain white square background.","n":1}')
  [ "$HTTP" = "200" ] && break
  jq -c '.error' "$RESP_FILE"
done
jq '{created,provider,usage,data_count:(.data|length)}' "$RESP_FILE"
[ "$HTTP" = "200" ]
jq -e '
  .provider == "gemini"
  and (.data | length) == 1
  and (.data[0].url // "") == ""
  and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.usage.total_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
assert_png_from_b64_json "$RESP_FILE" 0 "$QA_RUN_DIR/s209.png"
```

### S210 Image generation routes through virtual models and the provider hint

Image requests resolve through the same registry as chat: an alias redirects to
an image model, and a `provider` hint disambiguates a model ID that several
providers serve.

```bash
SRC="qa-img-alias-$QA_SUFFIX"
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-image-1-mini\",\"description\":\"qa images alias\"}" \
  | jq -e --arg s "$SRC" '.source == $s and .kind == "redirect"' >/dev/null

RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s210.alias.json"
curl -fsS -o "$RESP_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"$SRC\",\"prompt\":\"a small blue square\",\"n\":1,\"size\":\"1024x1024\",\"quality\":\"low\"}"
jq -e '.provider == "openai" and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null

curl -fsS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"source\":\"$SRC\"}" >/dev/null

HINT_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s210.hint.json"
curl -fsS -o "$HINT_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"gemini-2.5-flash-image","provider":"gemini","prompt":"Generate an image: a solid green triangle on a plain white background.","n":1}'
jq -e '.provider == "gemini" and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)' "$HINT_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S211 Edit an uploaded image on OpenAI

Checks `POST /v1/images/edits`: a multipart upload returns the same envelope,
and `gpt-image-1`-family usage counts the uploaded pixels as input image tokens.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s211.edits.json"
HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$RESP_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/v1/images/edits" \
  -F model=gpt-image-1-mini \
  -F "image=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
  -F 'prompt=Paint the whole canvas solid blue' \
  -F size=1024x1024 \
  -F quality=low)
jq '{created,provider,usage,data_count:(.data|length)}' "$RESP_FILE"
[ "$HTTP" = "200" ]
jq -e '
  .provider == "openai"
  and (.data | length) == 1
  and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.usage.input_tokens_details.image_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
assert_png_from_b64_json "$RESP_FILE" 0 "$QA_RUN_DIR/s211.png"
```

### S212 Edit an uploaded image through Gemini's native API

Checks the Gemini edit path: uploads become inline image parts ahead of the
prompt on `generateContent`, and the result comes back as `b64_json`.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s212.edits.json"
# Same upstream variance as S209: a Gemini image model sometimes answers with
# text only (`502 Gemini returned no images`), so retry before failing.
HTTP=000
for _ in $(seq 1 3); do
  HTTP=$(curl -sS -o "$RESP_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' "$BASE_URL/v1/images/edits" \
    -F model=gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image \
    -F "image=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
    -F 'prompt=Edit this image: paint the whole canvas solid blue and return the image.')
  [ "$HTTP" = "200" ] && break
  jq -c '.error' "$RESP_FILE"
done
jq '{created,provider,usage,data_count:(.data|length)}' "$RESP_FILE"
[ "$HTTP" = "200" ]
jq -e '
  .provider == "gemini"
  and (.data | length) == 1
  and (.data[0].b64_json | type == "string" and length > 0)
  and (.usage.input_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
assert_png_from_b64_json "$RESP_FILE" 0 "$QA_RUN_DIR/s212.png"
```

### S213 Image generation negatives

Streaming is rejected before any upstream call, an unknown model is a `404`, a
missing prompt is a `400`, and a chat model on a provider that has no image
support is refused by the router rather than mis-routed.

```bash
# Sends one generation request, asserts the status line, and leaves the parsed
# body in $IMG_BODY for the caller's own assertion.
img_gen_error() {
  local name="$1" body="$2" want_status="$3"
  local headers_file="$QA_RUN_DIR/s213.$name.headers"
  IMG_BODY="$QA_RUN_DIR/s213.$name.json"
  curl -sS -D "$headers_file" -o "$IMG_BODY" "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "$body"
  jq -c '.error' "$IMG_BODY"
  grep -Eiq "^HTTP/.* $want_status " "$headers_file"
}

img_gen_error stream '{"model":"gpt-image-1-mini","prompt":"a circle","stream":true}' 400
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("stream"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_gen_error unknown '{"model":"this-model-does-not-exist","prompt":"a circle"}' 404
jq -e '.error.type == "not_found_error"' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_gen_error noprompt '{"model":"gpt-image-1-mini"}' 400
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("prompt"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_gen_error unsupported '{"model":"anthropic/claude-sonnet-5","prompt":"a circle"}' 400
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("does not support image generation"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null
```

### S214 Image edit negatives

A missing upload and a streamed edit are rejected before any upstream call, a
provider without edit support is refused by the router, and Gemini rejects a
`mask` with the documented pointer instead of silently dropping it.

```bash
# Same shape as S213: asserts the status line and leaves the body in $IMG_BODY.
img_edit_error() {
  local name="$1" want_status="$2"
  shift 2
  local headers_file="$QA_RUN_DIR/s214.$name.headers"
  IMG_BODY="$QA_RUN_DIR/s214.$name.json"
  curl -sS -D "$headers_file" -o "$IMG_BODY" "$BASE_URL/v1/images/edits" "$@"
  jq -c '.error' "$IMG_BODY"
  grep -Eiq "^HTTP/.* $want_status " "$headers_file"
}

img_edit_error noimage 400 -F model=gpt-image-1-mini -F 'prompt=a circle'
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("image"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_edit_error stream 400 \
  -F model=gpt-image-1-mini -F "image=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
  -F 'prompt=a circle' -F stream=true
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("stream"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_edit_error unsupported 400 \
  -F model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-5 -F "image=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
  -F 'prompt=a circle'
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("does not support image edits"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null

img_edit_error mask 400 \
  -F model=gemini/gemini-2.5-flash-image \
  -F "image=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
  -F "mask=@$IMAGE_SOURCE_FILE;type=image/png" \
  -F 'prompt=a circle'
jq -e '.error.type == "invalid_request_error" and (.error.message | test("mask"))' "$IMG_BODY" >/dev/null
```

### S215 Image calls are metered and audited with image-body placeholders

An image request is billed like any other model call and lands in the audit log
as an image body. The release stack runs with `LOGGING_LOG_IMAGE_BODIES`
unset (the default), so each image is a sized placeholder (`stored: false`)
rather than embedded base64 — the entry stays small and never trips generic body
truncation. Storing the pixels themselves needs a gateway booted with that
variable on, so it is covered by unit tests
(`config/logging_test.go`, `internal/auditlog/image_body_test.go`).

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-images-usage-$QA_SUFFIX"
USER_PATH="/qa/images/$QA_SUFFIX"
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s215.images.json"

curl -fsS -o "$RESP_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/images/generations" \

done
LOG_ID=$(jq -er --arg request_id "$REQUEST_ID" 'first(.entries[]? | select(.request_id == $request_id) | .id)' "$AUDIT_FILE")

## 29. Realtime transcription sessions

These scenarios cover `intent=transcription` on `/v1/realtime` (#750). OpenAI
rejects a `model` query parameter on a transcription session, so a successful
handshake plus a relayed `realtime.transcription_session` object is what proves
the gateway dialed the intent-only URL while still routing, authorizing, and
metering the requested model. They are read-only and rerunnable in any order.

### S216 `intent=transcription` opens a transcription session

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-transcribe-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s216.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s216.body.XXXXXX")
STDERR_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s216.stderr.XXXXXX")

LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"type":"session.created"' "$BODY_FILE"
LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"object":"realtime.transcription_session"' "$BODY_FILE"
```

### S217 A realtime dial without `intent` stays a speech session (regression)

The same entry point without `intent` must keep opening an ordinary realtime
session, so forwarding the parameter did not change the default.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-speech-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s217.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s217.body.XXXXXX")

LC_ALL=C grep -aoE '"object":"[a-z_.]+"' "$BODY_FILE" | head -3
LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"object":"realtime.session"' "$BODY_FILE"

```

## 30. Gemini native embeddings

`S34` covers a single Gemini embedding; these cover the native
`batchEmbedContents` path (#754): several inputs in one call, and `dimensions`
mapped to `outputDimensionality`. Gemini reports no token usage on either
surface, so the usage block is present but zero. Read-only and rerunnable.

### S218 Gemini embeddings batch input and `dimensions` mapping

## 31. Effective resilience configuration

### S219 Provider status exposes the circuit-breaker switch and its thresholds

`/admin/providers/status` reports the effective resilience settings per
provider, including the circuit-breaker enable switch (#729) and the configurable
status policies and breaker scope (#896). The release stack sets no resilience
overrides, so every provider must report the documented defaults: the breaker on,
five failures to open, two successes to close, a 30s timeout, `provider` scope,
retries on `429,502,503,504,522,524`, and the breaker tripping on `429,5xx`.
Turning the breaker off, narrowing the status lists, or switching a provider to
`model` scope needs a gateway booted with `RESILIENCE_*` overrides, so those paths
are covered by the `config`, `internal/providers` and `internal/llmclient` unit
tests. The stack manager deletes every unmanaged (dashboard-registered) provider
credential on `start`, so a leftover runtime credential cannot make this
assertion nondeterministic.

```bash
STATUS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s219.status.json"
curl -fsS -o "$STATUS_FILE" "$BASE_URL/admin/providers/status"
jq -c '[.providers[] | {name, cb: .config.resilience.circuit_breaker}] | .[0:3]' "$STATUS_FILE"

## 32. Realtime speech translation sessions

These scenarios cover the translation surface (`gpt-realtime-translate`), which
OpenAI serves from its own endpoint rather than the conversation one. A
successful handshake plus a relayed `"type":"translation"` session object is what
proves the gateway dialed `/v1/realtime/translations` upstream while routing,
authorizing, and metering the requested model. They are read-only and rerunnable
in any order.

### S220 `/v1/realtime/translations` opens a translation session

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-translate-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s220.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s220.body.XXXXXX")
STDERR_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s220.stderr.XXXXXX")
assert_realtime_websocket_upgrade \
  "$BASE_URL/v1/realtime/translations?model=gpt-realtime-translate&provider=openai" \
  "$HEADERS_FILE" \
  "$BODY_FILE" \
  "$REQUEST_ID" \
  "$STDERR_FILE"
LC_ALL=C grep -aoE '"type":"[a-z_.]+"' "$BODY_FILE" | head -5
LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"type":"session.created"' "$BODY_FILE"
LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"type":"translation"' "$BODY_FILE"
```

### S221 `intent=translation` reaches the same session

The typed route is a shorthand: dialing `/v1/realtime` with the intent must open
the identical translation session.

```bash
REQUEST_ID="qa-realtime-translate-intent-$QA_SUFFIX"
HEADERS_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s221.headers.XXXXXX")
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s221.body.XXXXXX")
STDERR_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s221.stderr.XXXXXX")
assert_realtime_websocket_upgrade \
  "$BASE_URL/v1/realtime?model=gpt-realtime-translate&intent=translation&provider=openai" \
  "$HEADERS_FILE" \
  "$BODY_FILE" \
  "$REQUEST_ID" \
  "$STDERR_FILE"
LC_ALL=C grep -aoE '"type":"[a-z_.]+"' "$BODY_FILE" | head -5
LC_ALL=C grep -aq '"type":"translation"' "$BODY_FILE"
```

### S222 Translation client secrets mint on the translation surface

```bash
SECRET_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s222.client_secret.json"
curl -fsS -o "$SECRET_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/realtime/translations/client_secrets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session":{"model":"gpt-realtime-translate","audio":{"output":{"language":"es"}}}}'
jq '{value:(.value[0:6]+"..."),session:{type:.session.type,model:.session.model,language:.session.audio.output.language}}' "$SECRET_FILE"
jq -e '
  (.value | startswith("ek_"))
  and .session.type == "translation"
  and .session.model == "gpt-realtime-translate"
  and .session.audio.output.language == "es"
' "$SECRET_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S223 Translation on a provider without a translation surface is rejected

Only OpenAI serves translation sessions today. A translation request routed to
another realtime provider must fail with a 400 instead of quietly opening an
ordinary conversation session — or minting a client secret for one.

```bash
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s223.body.XXXXXX")
STATUS=$(curl -sS -o "$BODY_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' \
  -H 'Connection: Upgrade' -H 'Upgrade: websocket' \
  -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Version: 13' -H 'Sec-WebSocket-Key: dGhlIHNhbXBsZSBub25jZQ==' \
  "$BASE_URL/v1/realtime/translations?model=grok-voice-latest&provider=xai")
test "$STATUS" = "400"
jq -e '.error.message | test("does not support translation realtime sessions")' "$BODY_FILE" >/dev/null

SECRET_FILE=$(mktemp "$QA_RUN_DIR/s223.secret.XXXXXX")
STATUS=$(curl -sS -o "$SECRET_FILE" -w '%{http_code}' \
  "$BASE_URL/v1/realtime/translations/client_secrets" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"session":{"model":"grok-voice-latest"}}')
test "$STATUS" = "400"
jq -e '.error.message | test("does not support translation realtime sessions")' "$SECRET_FILE" >/dev/null
```

## 33. Provider inventory filtering

The release stack narrows OpenRouter to its `:free` inventory with
`OPENROUTER_MODEL_FILTER_INCLUDE=*:free`. No other release scenario routes to
OpenRouter, so this exercises the production filter without reducing coverage
elsewhere or adding a billable provider call.

### S224 OpenRouter inventory includes only free-tier models

The admin inventory is the routing catalog, while `/v1/models` is its public
projection. Both must contain at least one OpenRouter model and must not leak a
model rejected by the configured glob.

```bash
ADMIN_MODELS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s224.admin-models.json"
PUBLIC_MODELS_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s224.public-models.json"
curl -fsS -o "$ADMIN_MODELS_FILE" "$BASE_URL/admin/models"
curl -fsS -o "$PUBLIC_MODELS_FILE" "$BASE_URL/v1/models"

jq -e '
  [.[] | select(.provider_name == "openrouter")] as $models
  | ($models | length) > 0
    and all($models[]; .model.id | endswith(":free"))
' "$ADMIN_MODELS_FILE" >/dev/null
jq -e '
  [.data[] | select(.id | startswith("openrouter/"))] as $models
  | ($models | length) > 0
    and all($models[]; .id | endswith(":free"))
' "$PUBLIC_MODELS_FILE" >/dev/null
```

## 34. Recent release regressions

### S225 Anthropic accepts an image nested in a `tool_result`

Claude Code and similar agents return screenshots inside tool results. This
request exercises the native Anthropic history shape through the public
Messages endpoint and verifies that the gateway no longer rejects or drops it.

```bash
RESP_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s225.message.json"
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/messages" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model":"claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "max_tokens":32,
    "tools":[{"name":"inspect_image","description":"Inspect an image","input_schema":{"type":"object","properties":{}}}],
    "messages":[
      {"role":"assistant","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_qa_image","name":"inspect_image","input":{}}]},
      {"role":"user","content":[{"type":"tool_result","tool_use_id":"toolu_qa_image","content":[
        {"type":"text","text":"The image is a single white pixel. Reply with exactly QA_TOOL_IMAGE_OK."},
        {"type":"image","source":{"type":"base64","media_type":"image/png","data":"iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAADUlEQVR42mP8z8BQDwAEhQGAhKmMIQAAAABJRU5ErkJggg=="}}
      ]}]}
    ]
  }' > "$RESP_FILE"
jq -e '
  .type == "message"
  and .role == "assistant"
  and any(.content[]?; .type == "text" and (.text | contains("QA_TOOL_IMAGE_OK")))
  and (.usage.input_tokens > 0)
' "$RESP_FILE" >/dev/null
```

### S226 Pricing overrides supersede time-window rates in recorded cost

DeepSeek publishes lower off-peak input and output rates. Explicit operator
overrides must win at every hour, which is verified against the token counts and
costs persisted for a real request.

```bash
SELECTOR="deepseek/deepseek-flash"
cleanup_s226() {
  curl -sS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/model-pricing-overrides" \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d "{\"selector\":\"$SELECTOR\"}" >/dev/null || true
}
trap cleanup_s226 EXIT

### S227 One corrupt virtual-model timestamp does not fail the listing

Simulates a row written with a wildly incorrect host clock. The SQL store must
drop the unrepresentable timestamps while keeping the complete admin listing
JSON-encodable and available.

```bash
NAME="qa_corrupt_ts_$QA_BUDGET_SUFFIX"
DB="$RELEASE_STACK_DIR/sqlite-main/data/gomodel.db"
cleanup_s227() {
  curl -sS -X DELETE "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\"}" >/dev/null || true
  sqlite3 "$DB" "DELETE FROM virtual_models WHERE source = '$NAME';" || true
}
trap cleanup_s227 EXIT
curl -fsS -X PUT "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"source\":\"$NAME\",\"target_model\":\"openai/gpt-4.1-nano\"}" >/dev/null
sqlite3 "$DB" "UPDATE virtual_models SET created_at = 99999999999999, updated_at = 99999999999999 WHERE source = '$NAME';"

curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/admin/virtual-models" \
  | jq -e --arg name "$NAME" '

### S228 Gemini 3 tool-call round trip preserves the thought signature

Gemini 3 attaches a `thoughtSignature` to every function call and rejects a
follow-up request whose history lacks it (HTTP 400). The gateway must expose
it as `tool_calls[].extra_content.google.thought_signature` and send it back
when the client echoes the assistant turn verbatim, as OpenAI SDK agent loops
do.

```bash
CALL_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s228.call.json"
FOLLOW_FILE="$QA_RUN_DIR/s228.followup.json"
TOOLS='[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"lookup_weather","description":"Get the current weather for a city","parameters":{"type":"object","properties":{"city":{"type":"string"}},"required":["city"]}}}]'
curl -fsS "$BASE_URL/v1/chat/completions" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"model\":\"gemini-3.5-flash-lite\",\"tools\":$TOOLS,\"tool_choice\":{\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"lookup_weather\"}},\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What is the weather in Warsaw?\"}]}" \

jq -e '
