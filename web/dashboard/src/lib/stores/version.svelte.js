// Update awareness. The gateway owns the outbound check; the dashboard only
// asks GET /version for its result and renders it.
//
// GET /version is always called, on every page load: it is a local request
// that answers from the gateway's cache, and the result has to be in hand for
// the update indicator to render at all. The once-a-day gate belongs to the
// *outbound* call to the release host, and the backend owns it — it reads the
// `gomodel_version_check` cookie and only goes out to the network when this
// browser has not checked in today.
//
// The one thing the cookie decides here is timing: when this browser is due,
// the request may trigger that outbound call, so it is delayed by a random
// pause to keep a fleet of dashboards opened after a rollout from arriving at
// the release host in one burst. When it is not due, nothing outbound can
// happen, so the request goes immediately and the indicator paints at once.
